      "14. Under national GAAP, institutions that are permitted or required to apply certain valuation rules for financial instruments in accordance with IFRS shall submit, to the extent that those rules are applied, the relevant IFRS accounting portfolios. Where the valuation rules for financial instruments that institutions are permitted or required to use under national GAAP based on BAD do refer to the valuation rules in IAS 39, institutions shall submit the accounting portfolios based on BAD for all their financial instruments until the valuation rules they apply refer to the valuation rules in IFRS 9.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.1. Financial assets\n",
      "15. The following accounting portfolios based on IFRS shall be used for financial assets:\n",

      "17. ‘Trading financial assets’ includes all financial assets classified as trading under the relevant national GAAP based on BAD. Irrespective of the measurement methodology applied under the relevant national GAAP based on BAD, all derivatives with a positive balance for the reporting institution that are not classified as hedge accounting in accordance with paragraph 22 of this Part shall be reported as trading financial assets. That classification shall also apply to derivatives which according to national GAAP based on BAD are not recognised on the balance-sheet, or have only the changes in their fair value recognised on-balance sheet or which are used as economic hedges as defined in paragraph 137 of Part 2 of this Annex.\n",
      "18. Under national GAAP based on BAD, for financial assets, ‘cost-based methods’ shall include those valuation rules by which the debt instrument is measured at cost plus interest accrued less impairment losses.\n",
      "19. Under national GAAP based on BAD, ‘Non-trading non-derivative financial assets measured at a cost-based method’ includes financial instruments measured at cost-based methods as well as instruments measured at the lower of cost or market (‘LOCOM’) under a non-continuous basis (moderate LOCOM), regardless of their actual measurement as of the reporting reference date. Assets measured at moderate LOCOM are assets for which LOCOM is applied only in specific circumstances.  provides for those circumstances, such as impairment, a prolonged decline in fair value compared to cost or change in the management intent.\n",
      "20. Under national GAAP based on BAD, ‘Other non-trading non-derivative financial assets’ shall include financial assets that do not qualify for inclusion in other accounting portfolios. That accounting portfolio includes, among others, financial assets that are measured at LOCOM on a continuous basis (‘strict LOCOM’). Assets measured at strict LOCOM are assets for which  either provides for the initial and subsequent measurement at LOCOM, or the initial measurement at cost and the subsequent measurement at LOCOM.\n",
      "21. Regardless of their measurement method, investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates that are not fully or proportionally consolidated under the regulatory scope of consolidation are reported in ‘Investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates’, except where they are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5.\n",
      "22. ‘’ shall include derivatives with a positive balance for the reporting institution held for hedge accounting under IFRS. Under national GAAP based on BAD, banking book derivatives shall be classified as derivatives held for hedge accounting only where there are special accounting rules for banking book derivatives under the relevant national GAAP based on BAD and the derivatives reduce risk of another position in the banking book.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.2. Financial liabilities\n",

      "25. ‘Trading financial liabilities’ includes all financial liabilities classified as trading under the relevant national GAAP based on BAD. Irrespective of the measurement methodology applied under the relevant national GAAP based on BAD, all derivatives with a negative balance for the reporting institution that are not classified as hedge accounting in accordance with paragraph 26 of this Part shall be reported as trading financial liabilities. That classification shall also apply to derivatives which according to national GAAP based on BAD are not recognised on the balance-sheet, or have only the changes in their fair value recognised on-balance sheet or which are used as economic hedges as defined in paragraph 137 of Part 2 of this Annex.\n",
      "26. ‘’ shall include derivatives with a negative balance for the reporting institution held for hedge accounting under IFRS. Under national GAAP based on BAD, banking book derivatives shall be classified as hedge accounting only if there are special accounting rules for banking book derivatives under the relevant national GAAP based on BAD and the derivatives reduce risk of another position in the banking book.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\n",
      "27.   as well as this Annex, \"the carrying amount\" means the amount to be reported in the balance sheet. The carrying amount of financial instruments shall include accrued interest. Under the relevant national GAAP based on BAD, the carrying amount of derivatives either shall be the carrying amount under national GAAP including accruals, premium values and provisions if applicable, or it shall be equal to zero where derivatives are not recognised on-balance sheet.\n",
      "28. If recognised under the relevant national GAAP based on BAD, accruals and deferrals of financial instruments including interest accrual, premiums and discounts or transaction costs shall be reported together with the instrument and not as other assets or other liabilities.\n",
      "29. Where applicable under national GAAP based on BAD, ‘Haircuts for trading positions valued at fair value’ shall be reported. The haircuts decrease the value of trading assets and increase the value of trading liabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.1. Financial assets\n",
      "30. Financial assets shall be distributed among the following classes of instruments: ‘Cash on hand’, ‘Derivatives’,\n",

The change in accumulated hedge ineffectiveness reported in this row shall be the difference between the changes in the variation of the fair value of the equity instrument reported in ‘Fair value changes of equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (hedged item)’ and the changes in the variation of the fair value of the hedging derivative reported in ‘Fair value changes of equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (hedging instrument)’.\n",
      "58. ‘Hedge of net investments in foreign operations (effective portion)’ shall include the change in the accumulated foreign currency translation reserve for the effective portion of both on-going and discontinued hedges of net investments in foreign operations.\n",
      "59. For hedges of net investment in foreign operations and cash flow hedges, the respective amounts reported in ‘Transferred to profit or loss’ shall include amounts transferred because the hedged flows have occurred and are no longer expected to occur.\n",

      "4. BREAKDOWN OF FINANCIAL ASSETS BY INSTRUMENT AND BY COUNTERPARTY SECTOR (4)\n",
      "67. Financial assets shall be broken down by accounting portfolio and instrument and - where required - by counterparty. For debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income and at amortised cost, the gross carrying amount of assets and accumulated impairments shall be broken down by impairment stages, except where they are purchased or originated financial assets that are credit-impaired at initial recognition as defined in IFRS 9 Appendix A. For these assets, the gross carrying amount and accumulated impairment shall be separately reported, outside the impairment stages, in templates 4.3.1 and 4.4.1.\n",
      "68. Derivatives reported as trading financial assets under GAAP based on BAD include instruments measured at fair value as well as instruments measured at cost-based methods or LOCOM.\n",
      "69.   as well as this Annex, ‘accumulated negative changes in fair value due to credit risk’ means, for non-performing exposures, accumulated changes in fair value due to credit risk where the accumulated net change is negative. The accumulated net change in fair value due to credit risk shall be calculated by adding all negative and positive changes in fair value due to credit risk that have occurred since recognition of the debt instrument. That amount shall only be reported where the addition of positive and negative changes in fair value due to credit risk results in a negative amount. The valuation of the debt instruments shall be performed on the level of single financial instruments. For each debt instrument, ‘Accumulated negative changes in fair value due to credit risk’ shall be reported until the derecognition of the instrument.\n",
      "70.   as well as this Annex, ‘accumulated impairment’ shall have the following meaning:\n",
      "(a) for debt instruments measured at amortised cost or at a cost-based method, that are not purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets, accumulated impairment is the cumulative amount of impairment losses, net of use and reversals that has been recognised, where appropriate for each of the impairment stages. Accumulated impairment reduces the carrying amount of the debt instrument through the use of an allowance account under IFRS and national GAAP based on BAD, or via direct reductions that do not constitute a derecognition event under national GAAP based on BAD;\n",
      "(b) for debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income under IFRS that are not purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets, accumulated impairment is the sum of expected credit losses and their variations recognised as a reduction of fair value on a given instrument since initial recognition;\n",
      "(c) for debt instruments at fair value through equity under national GAAP based on BAD subject to impairment, accumulated impairment is the cumulative amount of impairment losses, net of use and reversals that has been recognised. The reduction in the carrying amount is either made through use of an allowance account or via direct reductions that do not constitute a derecognition event.\n",
      "(d) for purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets, the initial estimate of lifetime expected credit losses is incorporated into the calculation of the credit-adjusted effective interest rate and accumulated impairment is the sum of subsequent changes in lifetime expected credit losses since initial recognition that are recognized as a variation of carrying amount/fair value on a given instrument. Accumulated impairment for purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets can be positive in case of impairment gains exceeding any previously recognised impairment losses (IFRS 9.5.5.14).\n",
      "71. UnderIFRS,accumulatedimpairmentshallincludetheallowanceforexpectedcreditlossesforfinancialassets under each of the impairment stages specified by IFRS 9 and the allowance for purchased or originated credit- impaired financial assets. Under national GAAP based on BAD, it shall include specific and general allowance for credit risk, as well as the general allowance for banking risk where it reduces the carrying amount of debt instruments. Accumulated impairment shall also include the credit risk-induced value adjustments on financial assets under LOCOM.\n",
      "72. ‘Accumulated partial write-offs’ and ‘Accumulated total write-offs’ shall include, respectively, the accumulated partial and total amount as at the reference date of principal and accrued past due interest and fees of any debt instrument that has been de-recognised to date using either of the methods described in paragraph 74 because the institution has no reasonable expectations of recovering the contractual cash flows. Those amounts shall be reported until the total extinguishment of all the reporting institution’s rights by expiry of the statute-of-limitations period, forgiveness or other causes, or until recovery. Therefore, where the written-off amounts are not recovered, they shall be reported while they are subject to enforcement activities.\n",
      "73. Where a debt instrument is eventually totally written-off because of successive partial write-offs, the cumu­ lative amount written-off shall be reclassified from the ‘Accumulated partial write-offs’ into the ‘Accumulated total write-offs’ column.\n",
      "74. Write-offs shall constitute a derecognition event and relate to a financial asset in its entirety or to a portion of it, including where the modification of an asset leads the institution to give up its right of collecting cash flows on a portion or the entirety of this asset as further explained in paragraph 72. Write-offs shall include amounts caused by both reductions of the carrying amount of financial assets recognised directly in profit or loss and reductions in the amounts of the allowance accounts for credit losses taken against the carrying amount of financial assets.\n",
      "75. The column ‘of which: Instruments with low credit risk’ shall include instruments that are determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date and for which the institution assumes that the credit risk has not increased significantly since initial recognition in accordance with IFRS 9.5.5.10.\n",
      "76. Trade receivables within the meaning of IAS 1.54(h), contract assets and lease receivables for which the simplified approach of IFRS 9.5.5.15 for the estimation of loss allowances has been applied, shall be reported within loans and advances in template 4.4.1. The corresponding loss allowance for those assets that are not purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets shall be reported in either ‘Accumulated impairment on assets with significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition but not credit-impaired (Stage 2)’ or ‘Accumulated impairment on credit-impaired assets (Stage 3)’, depending on whether trade receivables, contract assets or lease receivables under the simplified approach are considered as credit-impaired assets.\n",
      "78. In template 4.5, institutions shall report the carrying amount of ‘Loans and advances’ and ‘Debt securities’ that fall within the definition of ‘subordinated debt’ in paragraph 100 of this Part.\n",
      "79. In template 4.8, information to be reported depends on whether Non-trading non-derivative financial assets measured at fair value to equity can be subject to impairment requirements in application of the national GAAP based on BAD. Where those financial assets are subject to impairment, institutions shall report information in this template that relates to the carrying amount, the gross carrying amount of unimpaired assets and impaired assets, accumulated impairment and accumulated write-offs. Where those financial assets are not subject to impairment, institutions shall report the accumulated negative changes in fair value due to credit risk for non-performing exposures.\n",
      "80. In template 4.9, financial assets measured under moderate LOCOM and their associated value adjustments shall be identified separately from other financial assets measured at a cost-based method and their associated impairment. Financial assets under a cost-based method, including financial assets under moderate LOCOM, shall be reported as unimpaired assets where they have no value adjustments or impairment associated with them, and as impaired assets in case they have value adjustments that qualify as impairment or impairment associated with them. Value adjustments that qualify as impairment shall be credit risk-induced value adjustments reflecting the deterioration of the creditworthiness of the counterparty. Financial assets under moderate LOCOM with market-risk induced value adjustments reflecting the impact of changes in the market conditions on the value of the asset shall not be considered as impaired. Accumulated credit-risk induced and market-risk induced value adjustments shall be reported separately.\n",
      "81. In template 4.10, assets measured at strict LOCOM as well as their associated value adjustments shall be reported separately from assets under other measurement methods. Financial assets under strict LOCOM and financial assets under other measurement methods shall be reported as impaired assets in case they have credit-risk induced value adjustments as defined in paragraph 80 or impairment associated with them. Financial assets under strict LOCOM with market risk induced value adjustments as defined in paragraph 80 shall not be considered as impaired. Accumulated credit-risk induced and market-risk induced value adjustments shall be reported separately.\n",
      "82. Under national GAAP based on BAD, the amount of general allowances for banking risk to be reported in the applicable templates shall only be the part that affects the carrying amount of debt instruments (BAD Article 37.2).\n",

However, where the hybrid instrument is measured at fair value through profit or loss, the contract shall be reported as a whole and the embedded derivatives shall not be reported in .\n",
      "127. Commitments considered as derivatives (IFRS 9.2.3(b)) and credit derivatives that do not meet the definition of a financial guarantee in paragraph 114 of  shall be reported in template 10 and template 11 following the same breakdowns as the other derivative instruments, but not be reported in template 9.\n",

      "10.1. Classification of derivatives by type of risk\n",
      "129. All derivatives shall be classified into one of the following risk categories:\n",
      "(a) interest rate: Interest rate derivatives shall be contracts related to an interest-bearing financial instrument the cash flows of which are determined by referencing interest rates or another interest rate contract such as an option on a futures contract to purchase a treasury bill. That category shall be restricted to those deals where all the legs are exposed to only one currency’s interest rate. It shall thus exclude contracts involving the exchange of one or more foreign currencies such as cross-currency swaps and currency options, and other contracts the predominant risk characteristic of which is foreign exchange risk, which are to be reported as foreign exchange contracts. The only exception is where cross-currency swaps are used as part of a portfolio hedge of interest rate risk, where they shall be reported in the dedicated rows for those types of hedges. Interest rate contracts shall include forward rate agreements, single-currency interest rate swaps, interest rate futures, interest rate options (including caps, floors, collars and corridors), interest rate swaps and interest rate warrants;\n",
      "(b) equity: Equity derivatives shall be contracts that have a return, or a portion of their return, linked to the price of a particular equity or to an index of equity prices;\n",
      "(c) foreign exchange and gold: These derivatives shall include contracts involving the exchange of currencies in the forward market and the exposure to gold. They shall therefore cover outright forwards, foreign exchange swaps, currency swaps (including cross-currency interest rate swaps), currency futures, currency options, currency swaps and currency warrants. Foreign exchange derivatives shall include all deals involving exposure to more than one currency, whether in exchange rates or in interest rates, except where cross-currency swaps are used as part of a portfolio hedge of interest rate risk. Gold contracts shall include all deals involving exposure to that commodity;\n",
      "(d) credit: Credit derivatives shall be contracts in which the payout is linked primarily to some measure of the creditworthiness of a particular reference credit and that do not meet the definition of financial guarantees (IFRS 9.4.2.1 (c)). The contracts shall specify an exchange of payments in which at least one of the two legs is determined by the performance of the reference credit. Payouts can be triggered by a number of events, including a default, a rating downgrade or a stipulated change in the credit spread of the reference asset. Credit derivatives that meet the definition of a financial guarantee in paragraph 114 of  shall be reported only in template 9;\n",
      "(e) commodity: These derivatives shall be contracts that have a return, or a portion of their return, linked to the price of, or to a price index of, a commodity such as a precious metal (other than gold), petroleum, lumber or agricultural products;\n",
      "(f) other: those derivatives shall be any other derivative contracts, which do not involve an exposure to foreign exchange, interest rate, equity, commodity or credit risk such as climatic derivatives or insurance derivatives.\n",
      "130. Where a derivative is influenced by more than one type of underlying risk, the instrument shall be allocated to the most sensitive type of risk. For multi-exposure derivatives, in cases of uncertainty, the deals shall be allocated according to the following order of precedence:\n",
      "(a) commodities: All derivatives transactions involving a commodity or commodity index exposure, whether or not they involve a joint exposure in commodities and any other risk category which may include foreign exchange, interest rate or equity, shall be reported in this category;\n",
      "(b) equities:  contracts with a joint exposure to commodities and equities, which are to be reported as commodities, all derivatives transactions with a link to the performance of equities or equity indices shall be reported in the equity category. Equity deals with exposure to foreign exchange or interest rates shall be included in this category;\n",
      "(c) foreign exchange and gold: This category shall include all derivatives transactions ( those already reported in the commodity or equity categories) with exposure to more than one currency, be it pertaining to either interest-bearing financial instruments or exchange rates, except where cross- currency swaps are used as part of a portfolio hedge of interest rate risk.\n",
      "10.2. Amounts to be reported for derivatives\n",
      "131. Under IFRS, the ‘carrying amount’ for all derivatives (hedging or trading) shall be the fair value. Derivatives with a positive fair value (above zero) shall be ‘financial assets’ and derivatives with a negative fair value (below zero) shall be ‘financial liabilities’. The ‘carrying amount’ shall be reported separately for derivatives with a positive fair value (‘financial assets’) and for those with a negative fair value (‘financial liabilities’).  initial recognition, a derivative shall be classified as ‘financial asset’ or ‘financial liability’ according to its initial fair value. After initial recognition, as the fair value of a derivative increases or decreases, the terms of the exchange may become either favourable to the institution (and the derivative is classified as ‘financial asset’) or unfavourable (and the derivative is classified as ‘financial liability’). The carrying amount of hedging derivatives shall be their entire fair value, including, where applicable, the components of this fair value that are not designated as hedging instruments.\n",
      "132. In addition to carrying amounts as defined in paragraph 27 of , fair values shall be reported by reporting institutions under national GAAP based on BAD for all derivative instruments, whether required to be booked on-balance sheet or off-balance sheet by the national GAAP based on BAD.\n",
      "133. The ‘Notional amount’ shall be the gross nominal of all deals concluded and not yet settled at the reference date, regardless of whether those deals lead to derivative exposures being booked on-balance sheet. In particular, the following shall be taken into account to determine the notional amount:\n",
      "(a) for contracts with variable nominal or notional principal amounts, the basis for reporting shall be the nominal or notional principal amounts at the reference date;\n",
      "(b) the notional amount value to be reported for a derivative contract with a multiplier component shall be the contract effective notional amount or par value;\n",
      "(c) swaps: The notional amount of a swap shall be the underlying principal amount upon which the exchange of interest, foreign exchange or other income or expense is based;\n",
      "(d) equity and commodity-linked contracts: The notional amount to be reported for an equity or commodity contract shall be the quantity of the commodity or equity product contracted for purchase or sale multiplied by the contract price of a unit. The notional amount to be reported for commodity contracts with multiple exchanges of principal shall be the contractual amount multiplied by the number of remaining exchanges of principal in the contract;\n",
      "(e) credit derivatives: The contract amount to be reported for credit derivatives shall be the nominal value of the relevant reference credit;\n",
      "(f) digital options have a predefined payoff, which can be either a monetary amount or a number of contracts of an underlying. The notional amount for digital options shall be either the predefined monetary amount or the fair value of the underlying at the reference date.\n",
      "134.\n",
      "135.\n",
      "136.\n",
      "The column ‘Notional amount’ of derivatives shall include, for each line item, the sum of the notional amounts of all contracts in which the institution is counterparty, irrespective of whether the derivatives are considered assets or liabilities on the face of the balance sheet or are not booked on-balance sheet. All notional amounts shall be reported, regardless of whether the fair value of derivatives is positive, negative or equal to zero. Netting among the notional amounts shall not be allowed.\n",
      "The ‘Notional amount’ shall be reported by ‘total’ and by ‘of which: sold’ for the line items: ‘OTC options’, ‘Organised market options’, ‘Credit’, ‘Commodity’ and ‘Other’. The item ‘of which sold’ shall include the notional amounts (strike price) of the contracts in which the counterparties (option holders) of the institution (option writer) have the right to exercise the option, and for the items related to credit risk derivatives, the notional amounts of the contracts in which the institution (protection seller) has sold (gives) protection to its counterparties (protection buyers).\n",
      "The allocation of a transaction as ‘OTC’ or ‘Organized market’ shall be based on the nature of the market where the transaction takes place and not on whether there is a mandatory clearing obligation for that transaction. An ‘Organised market’ is a regulated market in the meaning of point (92) of Article 4(1) CRR. Therefore, where a reporting entity enters into a derivative contract in an OTC market where central clearing is compulsory, it shall classify that derivative as ‘OTC’ and not as ‘Organised market’.\n",
      "10.3. Derivatives classified as ‘economic hedges’\n",
      "137. Derivatives that are held for hedging purposes but which do not meet the criteria to be effective hedging instruments in accordance with IFRS 9, with IAS 39 where IAS 39 is applied for hedge accounting purposes or with the accounting framework under national GAAP based on BAD, shall be reported in template 10 as ‘economic hedges’. This shall apply also to all of the following cases:\n",
      "(a) derivatives hedging unquoted equity instruments for which cost may be an appropriate estimate of fair value;\n",
      "(b) credit derivatives measured at fair value through profit or loss used to manage the credit risk of all, or part of, a financial instrument that is designated as measured at fair value through profit or loss at, or subsequent to, initial recognition, or while it is unrecognised in accordance with IFRS 9.6.7.;\n",
      "(c) derivatives that are classified as ‘held for trading’ in accordance with Appendix A to IFRS 9 or classified as trading assets in accordance with the national GAAP based on BAD but are not part of the trading book as defined in point (86) of Article 4(1) CRR.\n",
      "138. ‘Economic hedges’ shall not include derivatives for proprietary trading.\n",
      "139. Derivatives that meet the definition of ‘economic hedges’ shall be reported separately in template 10 for each type of risk.\n",
      "140. Credit derivatives used to manage the credit risk of all, or part of, a financial instrument that is designated as measured at fair value through profit or loss at, or subsequent to, initial recognition, or while it is unre­ cognised in accordance with IFRS 9.6.7, shall be reported in a dedicated row in template 10 within credit risk. Other economic hedges of credit risk for which the reporting entity does not apply IFRS 9.6.7 shall be reported separately.\n",
      "10.4. Breakdown of derivatives by counterparty sector\n",
      "141. The carrying amount and the total notional amount of derivatives held for trading, and also of derivatives held for hedge accounting, which are traded in the OTC market, shall be reported by counterparties using the following categories:\n",
      "(a) ‘credit institutions’;\n",
      "(b) ‘other financial corporations’;\n",
      "(c) ‘rest’ comprising all other counterparties.\n",

      "10.5. Hedge accounting under national GAAP (11.2)\n",
      "143. Where national GAAP under BAD require the allocation of hedging derivatives across categories of hedges, the hedging derivatives shall be separately reported for each of the applicable categories: ‘fair-value hedges’, ‘cash flow hedges’, ‘cost-price hedges’, ‘hedge in net investments in a foreign operation’, ‘portfolio fair value hedges of interest rate risk’ and ‘portfolio cash flow hedges of interest rate risk’.\n",
      "144. Where applicable in accordance with national GAAP based on BAD, ‘Cost price hedges’ shall refer to a hedging category in which the hedging derivative is generally measured at cost.\n",
      "10.6. Amount to be reported for non-derivative hedging instruments (11.3 and 11.3.1)\n",
      "145. For non-derivative hedging instruments, the amount to be reported shall be the carrying amount of those non-derivative hedging instruments according to the applicable measurement rules in IFRS or in GAAP based on BAD for the accounting portfolios to which they belong. No ‘notional amount’ shall be reported for non- derivative hedging instruments.\n",
      "10.7. Hedged items in fair value hedges (11.4)\n",
      "146. The carrying amount of hedged items in a fair value hedge recognised on the statement of financial position shall be broken down by accounting portfolio and type of hedged risk for hedged financial assets and hedged financial liabilities. Where a financial instrument is hedged for more than one risk, it shall be reported in the type of risk in which the hedging instrument shall be reported in accordance with paragraph 129.\n",
      "147. ‘Micro-hedges’ shall be hedges other than portfolio hedge of interest rate risk in accordance with IAS 39.89 A. Micro-hedges shall include hedges of nil net positions  accordance with IFRS 9.6.6.6.\n",
      "148. ‘Hedge adjustments on micro-hedges’ shall include all hedge adjustments for all the micro-hedges as defined in paragraph 147.\n",
      "149. ‘Hedge adjustments included in the carrying amount of assets/liabilities’ shall be the accumulated amount of the gains and losses on the hedged items that have adjusted the carrying amount of those items and been recognised in profit or loss. Hedge adjustments for the hedged items that are equities measured at fair value through other comprehensive income shall be reported in template 1.3. Hedge adjustments for unrecognised firm commitments or a component thereof shall not be reported.\n",
      "150. ‘Remaining adjustments for discontinued micro-hedges including hedges of net positions’ shall include those hedge adjustments which, following the discontinuation of the hedge relationship and the end of the adjustment of hedged items for hedging gains and losses, remain to be amortised to the profit or loss via a recalculated effective interest rate for hedged items measured at amortised cost, or to the amount that represents the previously recognised cumulative hedging gain or loss for hedged assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income.\n",
      "151. Where a group of financial assets or financial liabilities, including a group of financial assets or financial liabilities that constitute a net position, is eligible as a hedged item, financial assets and financial liabilities constituting that group shall be reported at their carrying amount on a gross basis, before netting between instruments within the group, in ‘Assets or liabilities included in hedge of a net position (before netting)’.\n",
      "152. ‘Hedged items in portfolio hedge of interest rate risk’ shall include financial assets and financial liabilities included in a fair value hedge of the interest rate exposure of a portfolio of financial assets or financial liabilities.

Value adjustments on assets measured at the lower of cost or market shall not be reported in template 12.0.\n",
      "154. ‘Increases due to amounts set aside for estimated loan losses during the period’ shall be reported where, for the main category of assets or the counterparty, the estimation of the impairment for the period results in the recognition of net expenses; that is, for the given category or counterparty, the increases in the impairment for the period exceed the decreases. ‘Decreases due to amounts reversed for estimated loan losses during the period’ shall be reported where, for the main category of assets or counterparty, the estimation of the impairment for the period result in the recognition of net income; that is, for the given category or counterparty, the decreases in the impairment for the period exceed the increases.\n",

      "353. In template 25.3, information on collateral obtained by taking possession classified as Property Plant and Equipment (PP&E) shall be reported. In addition, the template shall provide information on the related ‘debt balance reduction’ and ‘value at initial recognition’ as defined in paragraphs 343 and 344 of this Part.\n",
      "354. Information shall be provided on the stock of collateral as of the reference date, irrespective of the point in time it was obtained, and the inflows due to new collateral obtained by taking possession during the period between the beginning and the end of the reference period and that remains recognised in the balance sheet at the reference date. With regard to the ‘debt balance reduction’, the ‘total’ shall reflect the debt balance reduction related to the collateral as of the reference date and the ‘inflows due to new collateral obtained by taking possession’ shall reflect the debt balance reduction related to the collateral that was obtained during the period.\n",

      "34. FORBEARANCE MANAGEMENT AND QUALITY OF FORBEARANCE (26)\n",
      "355. Template 26 shall include detailed information on loans and advances classified as forborne in accordance with paragraphs 240 to 268 of this Part, excluding instruments classified as cash balances at central banks and other demand deposits or as held for sale. Forborne exposures referring to either a modification of the previous terms and conditions or a total or partial refinancing of a troubled debt contract as defined in paragraph 241 of this Part shall be broken-down in more specific types of forbearance measures.\n",
      "356. The ‘Number of instruments’ shall be determined as defined in paragraph 320of this Part.\n",
      "357. The gross carrying amount of exposures with forbearance measures shall be allocated to a category reflecting the type of forbearance measure. Where multiple forbearance measures have been applied to an exposure, the gross carrying amount of exposures with forbearance measures shall be allocated to the most relevant type of forbearance measure. The latter shall be identified based on the type of forbearance measure which has the highest impact on the Net Present Value (NPV) of the forborne exposure or by using any other methods considered applicable.\n",
      "358. The types of forbearance measures shall be the following:\n",
      "(a) grace period/payment moratorium: temporary suspension of repayment obligations with regard to the principal or the interest, with repayments to be resumed at a later point in time;\n",
      "(b) interest rate reduction: permanent or temporary reduction of the interest rate (fixed or variable) to a fair and sustainable rate;\n",
      "(c) extension of maturity/term: extension of the maturity of the exposure, entailing a reduction in instalment amounts by spreading the repayments over a longer period;\n",
      "(d) rescheduled payments: adjustment of the contractual repayment schedule with or without changes to instalment amounts, other than grace periods/payment moratorium, extension of maturity/term and debt forgiveness. That category shall include, among others, capitalisation of arrears and/or accrued interest arrears to the outstanding principal balance for repayment under a sustainable, rescheduled programme; decrease of the amount of principal repayment instalments over a defined period, regardless of whether interests remain to be paid in full or whether they are capitalised or forfeited;\n",
      "(e) debt forgiveness: partial cancellation of the exposure by the reporting institution through forfeiture of right to legally recover it;\n",
      "(f) debt asset swaps: partial replacement of exposures  debt instruments with assets or equity;\n",
      "(g) other forbearance measures, including among others, total or partial refinancing of a troubled debt contract.\n",
      "359. Where the forbearance measure affects the gross carrying amount of an exposure, the gross carrying amount at the reference date, i.e. after application of the forbearance measure, shall be reported. In the case of refinancing, the gross carrying amount of the new contract (‘refinancing debt’) granted which qualifies as a forbearance measure, as well as the gross carrying amount of the old re-paid contract that is still outstanding shall be reported.\n",
      "360. The following items shall be reported in separate rows:\n",
      "(a) Instruments that were subject to forbearance measures at multiple points in time, where:\n",
      "(i) ‘Loans and advances having been forborne ‘twice’ and ‘more than twice’ shall mean exposures classified as forborne in accordance with paragraphs 240 to 268 of this Part at the reporting reference date, to which forbearance measures have been applied at two, respectively more than two different points in time. That includes, among others, originally forborne exposures that exited the forborne status (cured forborne exposures), but were granted new forbearance measures after that;\n",
      "(ii) ‘Loans and advances to which forbearance measures were granted in addition to already existing forbearance measures’ shall mean forborne exposures under probation to which forbearance measures were applied in addition to forbearance measures granted at an earlier point in time, without the exposure having cured in between.\n",
      "(b) Non-performing forborne exposures that failed to meet the non-performing exit criteria. That shall comprise non-performing forborne exposures that failed to meet the conditions for ceasing to be non- performing as described in paragraph 232 of this Part  the probation period of 1 year specified in paragraph 231 (b) of this Part.\n",
      "361. Exposures to which forbearance measures have been granted since the end of the last financial year shall be reported in separate columns.\n",
      "\n",
      "35. LOANS AND ADVANCES: AVERAGE DURATION AND RECOVERY PERIODS (47)\n",
      "362. The information provided in template 47 shall refer to loans and advances, excluding loans and advances classified as cash balances at central banks and other demand deposits, held for trading, trading financial assets or held for sale.\n",
      "363. The ‘weighted average time since past due date (in years)’ shall be calculated as the weighted average of the number of days past due of exposures classified as non-performing in accordance with  of this Part at the reference date. Non-performing exposures that are not past due shall be considered as being zero days past due in this calculation. Exposures shall be weighted by the gross carrying amount measured at the reference date. The weighted average time since past due date shall be expressed in years (with decimals).\n",
      "364. The following information on the results of litigation procedures on non-performing loans and advances concluded during the period shall be reported:\n",
      "(a) Net cumulated recoveries: This item shall include recoveries resulting from in-court procedures. Recoveries stemming from voluntary agreements shall not be included.\n",
      "(b) Gross carrying amount reduction: This item shall include the gross-carrying amount of non- performing loans and advances derecognised in response to the conclusion of a litigation procedure. This includes related write-offs.\n",
      "(c) Average duration of litigation procedures concluded in the period: shall be calculated as the average of the elapsed time between the date of classification of the instrument as ‘in litigation status’ in accordance with paragraph 322 of this Part and the date of the finalisation of legal proceedings; it shall be expressed in years (with decimals).\n",
