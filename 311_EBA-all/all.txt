C – CREDIT AND COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISKS AND FREE DELIVERIES: STANDARDISED APPROACH TO CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS (CR SA). General remarks 45. The CR SA templates provide the necessary information on the calculation of own funds requirements for credit risk in accordance with the Standardised approach. In particular, they provide detailed information on: a) the distribution of the exposure values according to the different, exposure types, risk weights and exposure classes; b) the amount and type of credit risk mitigation techniques used for mitigating the risks.. Scope of the CR SA template 46. In accordance with Article 112 CRR each SA exposure shall be assigned to one of the 16 SA exposure classes to calculate the own funds requirements.EN  . 47. The information in CR SA is required for the total exposure classes and individually for each of the exposure classes under the Standardised approach. The total figures as well as the information of each exposure class are reported in a separate dimension. 48. However the following positions are not within the scope of CR SA: (a) Exposures assigned to exposure class ‘items representing securitisation positions’ as referred to in point (m) of Article 112 CRR, which shall be reported in the CR SEC templates. (b) Exposures deducted from own funds. 49. The scope of the CR SA template shall cover the following own funds requirements: (a) Credit risk in accordance with Chapter 2 (Standardised approach) of Title II of Part Three CRR in the banking book, among which Counterparty credit risk in accordance with Chapters 4 and 6 (Counterparty credit risk) of Title II of Part Three CRR in the banking book; (b) Counterparty credit risk in accordance with Chapters 4 and 6 (Counterparty credit risk) of Title II of Part Three CRR in the trading book; (c) Settlement risk arising from free deliveries in accordance with Article 379 CRR in respect of all the business activities. 50. The template shall include all exposures for which the own funds requirements are calculated in accordance with Chapter 2 of Title II of Part Three CRR in conjunction with Chapters 4 and 6 of Title II of Part Three CRR. Institutions that apply Article 94(1) CRR also need to report their trading book positions referred to in point (b) of Article 92(3) CRR in this template when they apply Chapter 2 of Title II of Part Three CRR to calculate the own funds requirements thereof (Chapters 2 and 6 of Title II of Part Three and Title V of Part Three CRR). Therefore the template shall not only provide detailed information on the type of the exposure (e.g. on balance sheet/off balance sheet items), but also information on the allocation of risk weights within the respective exposure class. 51. In addition, CR SA includes memorandum items in rows to to collect further information about exposures secured by mortgages on immovable property and exposures in default. 52. Those memorandum items shall only be reported for the following exposure classes: (a) Central governments or central banks (point (a) of Article 112 CRR); (b) Regional governments or local authorities (point (b) of Article 112 CRR); (c) Public sector entities (point (c) of Article 112 CRR); (d) Institutions (point (f) of Article 112 CRR); (e) Corporates (point (g) of Article 112 CRR); (f) Retail (point (h) of Article 112 CRR). 53. The reporting of the memorandum items shall affect neither the calculation of the risk weighted exposure amounts of the exposure classes referred to in points (a) to (c) and (f) to (h) of Article 112 CRR nor of the exposure classes referred to in points (i) and (j) of Article 112 CRR reported in template CR SA. 54. The memorandum rows provide additional information about the obligor structure of the exposure classes ‘in default’ or ‘secured by immovable property’. Exposures shall be reported in these rows where the obligors would have been reported in the exposure classes ‘Central governments or central banks’, ‘Regional governments or local authorities’, ‘Public sector entities’, ‘Institutions’, ‘Corporates’ and ‘Retail’ of CR SA, if those exposures were not assigned to the exposure classes ‘in default’ or ‘secured by immovable property’. The figures reported, however, are the same as used to calculate the risk weighted exposure amounts in the exposure classes ‘in default’ or ‘secured by immovable property’.EN.   55. E.g. if an exposure, the risk exposure amounts of which are calculated in accordance with Article 127 CRR and the value adjustments are less than 20 %, then that information shall be reported in CR SA, row in the total and in the exposure class ‘in default’. If this exposure, before it defaulted, was an exposure to an institution, then that information shall also be reported in row of exposure class ‘institutions’.. Assignment of exposures to exposure classes under the Standardised approach 56. In order to ensure a consistent categorisation of exposures into the different exposure classes referred to in Article 112 CRR the following sequential approach shall be applied: (a) In a first step, the Original exposure pre-conversion factors shall be classified into the corresponding (original) exposure class referred to in Article 112 CRR, without prejudice to the specific treatment (risk weight) that each specific exposure shall receive within the assigned exposure class. (b) In a second step the exposures may be redistributed to other exposure classes due to the application of credit risk mitigation (CRM) techniques with substitution effects on the exposure (e.g. guarantees, credit derivatives, financial collateral simple method) via inflows and outflows. 57. The following criteria shall apply to for the classification of the Original exposure pre-conversion factors into the different exposure classes (first step) without prejudice to the subsequent redistribution caused by the use of CRM techniques with substitution effects on the exposure or to the treatment (risk weight) that each specific exposure shall receive within the assigned exposure class. 58. For the purpose of classifying the original exposure pre-conversion factor in the first step, the CRM techniques associated to the exposure shall not be considered (note that they shall be considered explicitly in the second phase) unless a protection effect is intrinsically part of the definition of an exposure class as it is the case in the exposure class referred to in point (i) of Article 112 CRR (exposures secured by mortgages on immovable property). 59. Article 112 CRR does not provide criteria for disjoining the exposure classes. This might imply that one exposure could potentially be classified in different exposure classes if no prioritisation in the assessment criteria for the classification is provided. The most obvious case arises between exposures to institutions and corporate with a short-term credit assessment (point (n) of Article 112 CRR) and exposures to institutions (point (f) of Article 112 CRR)/exposures to corporates (point (g) of Article 112 CRR). In that case, it is clear that there is an implicit prioritisation in CRR since it shall be assessed first if a certain exposure is fit for being assigned to Short-term exposures to institutions and corporates and only afterwards assessed if it fits for being assigned to exposures to institutions or exposures to corporates. Otherwise it is obvious that the exposure class referred to in point (n) of Article 112 CRR shall never be assigned an exposure. The example provided is one of the most obvious examples but is not the only one. It is worth noting that the criteria used for establishing the exposure classes under the Standardised approach are different (institutional categorisation, term of the exposure, past due status, etc.) which is the underlying reason for non-disjoint groupings. 60. For a homogeneous and comparable reporting it is necessary to specify prioritisation assessment criteria for the assignment of the Original exposure pre-conversion factor by exposure classes, without prejudice to the specific treatment (risk weight) that each specific exposure shall receive within the assigned exposure class. The prioritisation criteria presented below, using a decision tree scheme, are based on the assessment of the conditions explicitly laid down in CRR for an exposure to fit in a certain exposure class and, if that is the case, on any decision on the part of the reporting institutions or the supervisor on the applicability of certain exposure classes. Therefore, the outcome of the exposure assignment process for reporting purposes shall be in line with CRR provisions. That does not prohibit institutions from applying other internal assignment procedures that may also be consistent with all relevant CRR provisions and its interpretations issued by the appropriate fora.EN  . 61. An exposure class shall be given priority to others in the assessment ranking in the decision tree (i.e. it shall be first assessed if an exposure can be assigned to an exposure class, without prejudice to the outcome of that assessment) if otherwise no exposures would potentially be assigned to it. That will be the case where in the absence of prioritisation criteria one exposure class is a subset of others. Therefore, the criteria graphically depicted in the following decision tree would work on a sequential process. 62. With this background the assessment ranking in the decision tree mentioned below shall follow the following order: 1. Securitisation positions; 2. Items associated with particular high risk; 3. Equity exposures 4. Exposures in default; 5. Exposures in the form of units or shares in collective investment undertakings (‘CIU’)/Exposures in the form of covered bonds (disjoint exposure classes); 6. Exposures secured by mortgages on immovable property; 7. Other items; 8. Exposures to institutions and corporates with a short-term credit assessment; 9. All other exposure classes (disjoint exposure classes) which include Exposures to central governments or central banks; Exposures to regional governments or local authorities; Exposures to public sector entities; Exposures to multilateral development banks; Exposures to international organisations; Exposures to institutions; Exposures to corporate and Retail exposures. 63. In the case of exposures in the form of units or shares in collective investment undertakings and where the look through approach or the mandate-based approach (points (1) and (2) of Article 132a CRR) is used, the underlying individual (in the case of the look through approach) and individual group of (in the case of the mandate-based approach) exposures shall be considered and classified into their corresponding risk weight line according to their treatment. However, all the individual exposures shall be classified within the exposure class of Exposures in the form of units or shares in collective investment undertakings (‘CIU’). 64. ‘nth’ to default credit derivatives, as specified in Article 134(6) CRR that are rated shall be directly classified as securitisation positions. If they are not rated, they shall be considered in the ‘Other items’ exposure class. In that latter case, the nominal amount of the contract shall be reported as the Original exposure pre- conversion factors in the line for ‘Other risk weights’ (the risk weight used shall be that specified by the sum indicated under Article 134(6) CRR. 65. In a second step, as a consequence of credit risk mitigation techniques with substitution effects, exposures shall be reallocated to the exposure class of the protection provider. DECISION TREE ON HOW TO ASSIGN THE ORIGINAL EXPOSURE PRE-CONVERSION FACTORS TO THE EXPOSURE CLASSES OF THE STANDARDISED APPROACH IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CRR Original exposure pre-conversion factors Does it fit for being assigned to the exposure class of point (m) of Article 112 CRR? YES Securitisation positions NOEN.   Original exposure pre-conversion factors Does it fit for being assigned to the exposure class of point (k) of Article 112 CRR? YES Items associated with particular high risk (see also Article 128 CRR) NO Does it fit for being assigned to the exposure class of point (p) of Article 112 CRR? YES Equity exposures (see also Article 133 CRR) NO Does it fit for being assigned to the exposure class of point (j) of Article 112 CRR? YES Exposures in default NO Does it fit for being assigned to the exposure classes of points (l) and (o) of Article 112 CRR? YES Exposures in the form of units or shares in collective investment undertakings (CIU) Exposures in the form of covered bonds (see also Article 129 CRR) These two exposure classes are disjoint among themselves (see comments on the look- through approach in the answer above). Therefore the assignment to one of them is straightforward. NO Does it fit for being assigned to the exposure class of point (i) of Article 112 CRR? YES Exposures secured by mortgages on immovable property (see also Article 124 CRR) NO Does it fit for being assigned to the exposure class of point (q) of Article 112 CRR? YES Other items NOEN  . Original exposure pre-conversion factors Does it fit for being assigned to the exposure class of point (n) of Article 112 CRR? YES Exposures to institutions and corporates with a short-term credit assessment NO The exposure classes below are disjoint among themselves. Therefore the assignment to one of them is straightforward. Exposures to central governments or central banks Exposures to regional governments or local authorities Exposures to public sector entities Exposures to multilateral development banks Exposures to international organisations Exposures to institutions Exposures to corporates Retail exposures. Clarifications on the scope of some specific exposure classes referred to in Article 112 CRR. Exposure Class ‘Institutions’ 66. Intra-group exposures referred to in paragraphs 6 and 7 of Article 113 CRR shall be reported as follows: 67. Exposures which fulfil the requirements of Article 113(7) CRR shall be reported in the respective exposure classes where they would be reported if they were not intra-group exposures. 68. According to paragraphs 6 and 7 of Article 113 CRR an institution may, subject to the prior approval of the competent authorities, decide not to apply the requirements of paragraph 1 of that Article to the exposures of that institution to a counterparty which is its parent undertaking, its subsidiary, a subsidiary of its parent undertaking or an undertaking linked by a relationship within the meaning of Article 12(1) of Directive 83/349/EEC. That means that intra-group counterparties are not necessarily institutions but also undertakings which are assigned to other exposure classes, e.g. ancillary services undertakings or under takings within the meaning of Article 12(1) of Council Directive 83/349/EEC ( 7 ). Therefore intra-group exposures shall be reported in the corresponding exposure class.. Exposure Class ‘Covered Bonds’ 69. SA exposures shall be assigned to the exposure class ‘covered bonds’ as follows: 70. Bonds referred to in Article 52(4) of Directive /65/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 8 ) shall fulfil the requirements of paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 129 CRR to be classified in the exposure class ‘Covered Bonds’. The fulfilment of those requirements has to be checked in each case. Nevertheless, bonds referred to in Article 52(4) of Directive /65/EC and issued before 31 December shall also be assigned to the exposure class ‘Covered Bonds’ pursuant to Article 129(6) CRR.EN.

Exposure values for leases shall be subject to Article 134(7) CRR. In particular, the residual value shall be included at its accounting value (i.e. the discounted estimated residual value at the end of the lease term). 3. In the case of on-balance sheet netting as laid down in Article 219 CRR, the exposure values shall be reported taking into account the amount of the received cash collateral. Where institutions make use of the derogation of Article 473a(7a) CRR, they shall report the amount AB SA that is risk weighted at 100 % in the exposure class ‘other items’ in this column..

CREDIT AND COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISKS AND FREE DELIVERIES: IRB APPROACH TO OWN FUNDS REQUIREMENTS (CR IRB). Scope of the CR IRB template 72. The scope of the CR IRB template covers: i. Credit risk in the banking book, among which: — Counterparty credit risk in the banking book; — Dilution risk for purchased receivables; ii. Counterparty credit risk in the trading book; iii. Free deliveries resulting from all business activities. 73. The scope of the template refers to the exposures for which the risk weighted exposure amounts are calculated in accordance with Articles 151 to 157 of Chapter 3 of Title II of Part Three CRR (IRB approach). 74. The CR IRB template does not cover the following data: i. Equity exposures, which are reported in the CR EQU IRB template; ii. Securitisation positions, which are reported in the CR SEC and/or CR SEC Details templates; iii. ‘Other non credit-obligation assets’, as referred to in point (g) of Article 147(2) CRR. The risk weight for this exposure class has to be set at 100 % at any time except for cash in hand, equivalent cash items and exposures that are residual values of leased assets, in accordance with Article 156 CRR. The risk weighted exposure amounts for this exposure class shall be reported directly in the CA-Template; iv. Credit valuation adjustment risk, which is reported on the CVA Risk template; The CR IRB template does not require a geographical breakdown of IRB exposures by residence of the counterparty. This breakdown shall be reported in the template CR GB.EN  . Items i) and iii) do not apply to template CR IRB 7. 75. In order to clarify whether the institution uses its own estimates for LGD and/or credit conversion factors, the following information shall be provided for each reported exposure class: ‘NO’ = in case the supervisory estimates of LGD and credit conversion factors are used (Foundation IRB) ‘YES’ = in case own estimates of LGD and credit conversion factors are used (Advanced IRB). This includes all retail portfolios. In case an institution uses own estimates of LGDs to calculate risk weighted exposure amounts for a part of its IRB exposures as well as supervisory LGDs to calculate risk weighted exposure amounts for the other part of its IRB exposures, an CR IRB Total for F-IRB positions and one CR IRB Total for A-IRB positions has to be reported.. Breakdown of the CR IRB template 76. The CR IRB consists of seven templates. CR IRB 1 provides a general overview of IRB exposures and the different methods to calculate risk weighted exposure amounts as well as a breakdown of total exposures by exposure types. CR IRB 2 provides a breakdown of total exposures assigned to obligor grades or pools (exposures reported under row of CR IRB 1). CR IRB 3 provides all relevant parameters used for the calculation of credit risk capital requirements for IRB models. CR IRB 4 presents a flow statement explaining changes in risk weighted exposure amounts determined under the IRB approach for credit risk. CR IRB 5 provides information on the results of backtesting of PDs for the models reported. CR IRB 6 provides all relevant parameters used for the calculation of credit risk capital requirements under the slotting criteria for specialised lending. CR IRB 7 provides an overview of percentage of exposure value subject to SA or IRB approaches for each relevant exposure class. The templates CR IRB 1, CR IRB 2, CR IRB 3 and CR IRB 5 shall be reported separately for the following exposure and sub-exposure classes: 1. Total (The Total template must be reported for the Foundation IRB approach and, separately for the Advanced IRB approach.) 2. Central banks and central governments (point (a) of Article 147(2) CRR) 3. Institutions (point (b) of Article 147(2) CRR) ) Corporate – SME (point (c) of Article 147(2) CRR).

Instructions concerning specific positions  Instructions INTERNAL RATING SCALE/PD ASSIGNED TO THE OBLIGOR GRADE OR POOL (%) The PD assigned to the obligor grade or pool to be reported shall be based on the provisions laid down in Article 180 CRR. For each individual grade or pool, the PD assigned to the specific obligor grade or pool shall be reported. For figures corresponding to an aggregation of obligor grades or pools (e.g. total exposures), the exposure weighted average of the PDs assigned to the obligor grades or pools included in the aggregation shall be provided. The exposure value (column ) shall be used for the calculation of the exposure-weighted average PD. For each individual grade or pool, the PD assigned to the specific obligor grade or pool shall be reported. All reported risk parameters shall be derived from the risk parameters used in the internal rating scale approved by the respective competent authority. It is neither intended nor desirable to have a supervisory master scale. If the reporting institution applies a unique rating scale or is able to report in accordance with an internal master scale, that scale shall be used. Otherwise, the different rating scales shall be merged and ordered in accordance with the following criteria: Obligor grades of the different rating scales shall be pooled and ordered from the lower PD assigned to each obligor grade to the higher. Where the institution uses a large number of grades or pools, a reduced number of grades or pools to be reported may be agreed with the competent authorities. The same applies for continuous rating scales: a reduced number of grades to be reported shall be agreed with the competent authorities. Institutions shall contact their competent authority in advance if they want to report a different number of grades in comparison with the internal number of grades. The last rating grade or grades shall be dedicated for defaulted exposures with PD of 100 %. For the purposes of weighting the average PD, the exposure value reported in column 110 shall be used. The exposure weighted average PD shall be computed taking into account all exposures reported in a given row. In the row where only defaulted exposures are reported the average PD shall be of 100 %.EN  .  Instructions ORIGINAL EXPOSURE PRE-CONVERSION FACTORS Institutions shall report the exposure value before taking into account any value adjustments, provisions, effects due to credit risk mitigation techniques or credit conversion factors. The original exposure value shall be reported in accordance with Article 24 CRR and para graphs 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 and 7 of Article 166 CRR. The effect resulting from Article 166(3) CRR (effect of on balance sheet netting of loans and deposits) shall be reported separately as Funded Credit Protection and shall therefore not reduce the Original Exposure. For derivative instruments, repurchase transactions, securities or commodities lending or borrowing transactions, long settlement transactions and margin lending transactions subject to counterparty credit risk (Chapter 4 or Chapter 6 of Title II of Part Three CRR), the original exposure shall correspond to the exposure value arising from counterparty credit risk (see instructions to column ).

When own estimates of LGD are used in accordance with Article 183 CRR (except for paragraph 3), the relevant value used in the internal model shall be reported. Guarantees shall be reported in column where the adjustment is not made in the LGD. Where the adjustment is made in the LGD, the amount of the guarantee shall be reported in column. Regarding exposures subject to the double default treatment, the value of unfunded credit protection shall be reported in column. EN.    Instructions CREDIT DERIVATIVES: Where own estimates of LGD are not used, the Adjusted Value (G A ) as defined in Article 236(3) CRR shall be provided. Where own estimates of LGD are used in accordance with paragraph 3 of Article 183 CRR, the relevant value used in the internal modelling shall be reported. Where the adjustment is made in the LGD, the amount of the credit derivatives shall be reported in column. Regarding exposures subject to the double default treatment, the value of unfunded credit protection shall be reported in column. OTHER FUNDED CREDIT PROTECTION Collateral that has an effect on the PD of the exposure shall be capped at the value of the original exposure pre conversion factors. Where own estimates of LGD are not used, Article 232(1) CRR applies. Where own estimates of LGD are used, those credit risk mitigation techniques that have effects on PD shall be reported. The relevant nominal or market value shall be reported. Where an adjustment is made in the LGD, that amount shall be reported in column 170. - SUBSTITUTION OF THE EXPOSURE DUE TO CRM Outflows shall correspond to the covered part of the original exposure pre-conversion factors, that is deducted from the obligor’s exposure class and, where relevant, obligor grade or pool, and subsequently assigned to the guarantor’s exposure class and, where relevant, obligor grade or pool. That amount shall be considered as an inflow into the guarantor’s exposure class and, where relevant, obligor grades or pools.

The exposure value (column ) shall be used for the calculation of the exposure-weighted average PD. For each individual grade or pool, the PD assigned to the specific obligor grade or pool shall be reported. All reported risk parameters shall be derived from the risk parameters used in the internal rating scale approved by the respective competent authority. It is neither intended nor desirable to have a supervisory master scale. If the reporting institution applies a unique rating scale or is able to report in accordance with an internal master scale, that scale shall be used. Otherwise, the different rating scales shall be merged and ordered in accordance with the following criteria: Obligor grades of the different rating scales shall be pooled and ordered from the lower PD assigned to each obligor grade to the higher. Where the institution uses a large number of grades or pools, a reduced number of grades or pools to be reported may be agreed with the competent authorities. The same applies for continuous rating scales: a reduced number of grades to be reported shall be agreed with the competent authorities. Institutions shall contact their competent authority in advance if they want to report a different number of grades in comparison with the internal number of grades. The last rating grade or grades shall be dedicated for defaulted exposures with PD of 100 %. For the purposes of weighting the average PD, the exposure value reported in column 110 shall be used.

The CR EQU IRB template consists of two templates: CR EQU IRB 1 provides a general overview of IRB exposures of the equity exposure class and the different methods to calculate total risk exposure amounts. CR EQU IRB 2 provides a breakdown of total exposures assigned to obligor grades in the context of the PD/LGD approach. ‘CR EQU IRB’ refers to both ‘CR EQU IRB 1’ and ‘CR EQU IRB 2’ templates, as applicable, in the following instructions. 93. The CR EQU IRB template provides information on the calculation of risk weighted exposure amounts for credit risk (point (a) of Article 92(3) CRR) in accordance with Chapter 3 of Title II of Part Three CRR for equity exposures as referred to in point (e) of Article 147(2) CRR. 94. In accordance with Article 147(6) CRR, the following exposures shall be assigned to the equity exposure class: (a) non-debt exposures conveying a subordinated, residual claim on the assets or income of the issuer; (b) debt exposures and other securities, partnerships, derivatives, or other vehicles, the economic substance of which is similar to the exposures specified in point (a). 95. Collective investment undertakings treated in accordance with the simple risk weight approach as referred to in Article 152 CRR shall also be reported in the CR EQU IRB template. 96. In accordance with Article 151(1) CRR, institutions shall provide the CR EQU IRB template when applying one of the three approaches referred to in Article 155 CRR: — the Simple Risk Weight approach; — the PD/LGD approach; — the Internal Models approach. Moreover, institutions applying the IRB approach shall also report in the CR EQU IRB template risk- weighted exposure amounts for those equity exposures which attract a fixed risk-weight treatment (without however being explicitly treated in accordance with the Simple Risk Weight approach or the (temporary or permanent) partial use of the Standardised approach for credit risk), e.g. equity exposures attracting a risk- weight of 250 % in accordance with Article 48(4) CRR, respectively a risk-weight of 370 % in accordance with Article 471(2) CRR. 97. The following equity claims shall not be reported in the CR EQU IRB template: — Equity exposures in the trading book (where institutions are not exempted from calculating own funds requirements for trading book positions (Article 94 CRR)). — Equity exposures subject to the partial use of the Standardised approach (Article 150 CRR), including: — Equity exposures grandfathered in accordance with Article 495(1) CRR; — Equity exposures to entities the credit obligations of which are assigned a 0 % risk weight under the Standardised approach, including those publicly sponsored entities where a 0 % risk weight can be applied (point (g) of Article 150(1) CRR), — Equity exposures incurred under legislated programmes to promote specified sectors of the economy that provide significant subsidies for the investment to the institution and involve some form of government oversight and restrictions on the equity investments (point (h) of Article 150(1) CRR), — Equity exposures to ancillary services undertakings the risk weighted exposure amounts of which may be calculated in accordance with the treatment of ‘other non credit-obligation assets’ (Article 155(1) CRR),EN  . — Equity claims deducted from own funds in accordance with Articles 46 and 48 CRR.. Instructions concerning specific positions (applicable to both CR EQU IRB 1 and CR EQU IRB 2)  OBLIGOR GRADE (ROW IDENTIFIER) The obligor grade shall be a row identifier and shall be unique for each row in the template. It shall follow the numerical order 1, 2, 3, etc. INTERNAL RATING SCALE PD ASSIGNED TO THE OBLIGOR GRADE (%) Institutions applying the PD/LGD approach shall report in column the probability of default (PD) calculated in accordance with Article 165(1) CRR. The PD assigned to the obligor grade or pool to be reported shall be in line with the minimum requirements laid down in Section 6 of Chapter 3 of Title II of Part Three CRR. For each individual grade or pool, the PD assigned to that specific obligor grade or pool shall be reported. All reported risk parameters shall be derived from the risk parameters used in the internal rating scale approved by the respective competent authority. For figures corresponding to an aggregation of obligor grades or pools (e.g. ‘total exposures’), the exposure weighted average of the PDs assigned to the obligor grades or pools included in the aggregation shall be provided. All exposures, including defaulted exposures, are to be considered for the purpose of the calculation of the exposure weighted average PD. For the calculation of the exposure-weighted average PD, the exposure value taking into account unfunded credit protection (column ) shall be used for weighting purposes. ORIGINAL EXPOSURE PRE-CONVERSION FACTORS Institutions report in column the original exposure value (pre-conversion factors). In accordance with Article 167 CRR, the exposure value for equity exposures shall be the accounting value remaining after specific credit risk adjustments. The exposure value of off- balance sheet equity exposures shall be its nominal value after specific credit risk adjustments. Institutions shall also include in column the off balance sheet items referred to in Annex I CRR assigned to the equity exposure class (e.g. ‘the unpaid portion of partly-paid shares’). Institutions applying the Simple Risk Weight approach or the PD/LGD approach (as referred to in Article 165(1) CRR) shall also take into account the offsetting referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 155(2) CRR. - CREDIT RISK MITIGATION (CRM) TECHNIQUES WITH SUBSTITUTION EFFECTS ON THE EXPOSURE UNFUNDED CREDIT PROTECTION GUARANTEES CREDIT DERIVATIVES Irrespective of the approach adopted for the calculation of risk weighted exposure amounts for equity exposures, institutions may recognise unfunded credit protection obtained on equity exposures (Paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of Article 155 CRR). Institutions applying the Simple Risk Weight approach or the PD/LGD approach shall report in columns and the amount of unfunded credit protection under the form of guarantees (column ) or credit derivatives (column ) recognised in accordance with the methods set out in Chapter 4 of Title II of Part Three CRR.EN.

TOTAL OUTFLOWS Institutions shall report in column the part of the original exposure pre-conversion factors covered by unfunded credit protection recognised in accordance with the methods set out in Chapter 4 of Title II of Part Three CRR. EXPOSURE VALUE Institutions applying the Simple Risk Weight approach or the PD/LGD approach shall report in column the exposure value, taking into account substitution effects stemming from unfunded credit protection (Paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article 155 and Article 167 CRR). In the case of equity off-balance sheet exposures, the exposure value shall be the nominal value after specific credit risk adjustments (Article 167 CRR). OF WHICH: OFF BALANCE SHEET ITEMS See CR-SA instructions EXPOSURE WEIGHTED AVERAGE LGD (%) Institutions applying the PD/LGD approach shall report the exposure weighted average of the LGDs assigned to the obligor grades or pools included in the aggregation The exposure value taking into account unfunded credit protection (column ) shall be used for the calculation of the exposure-weighted average LGD. Institutions shall take into account Article 165(2) CRR. RISK WEIGHTED EXPOSURE AMOUNT Institutions shall report risk-weighted exposure amounts for equity exposures calculated in accordance with Article 155 CRR. Where institutions applying the PD/LGD approach do not have sufficient information to use the definition of default set out in Article 178 CRR, a scaling factor of 1,5 shall be assigned to the risk weights when calculating risk weighted exposure amounts (Article 155(3) CRR). With regard to the input parameter M (Maturity) to the risk-weight function, the maturity assigned to equity exposures equals 5 years (Article 165(3) CRR). MEMORANDUM ITEM: EXPECTED LOSS AMOUNT Institutions shall report in column the expected loss amount for equity exposures calculated in accordance with paragraphs 4, 7, 8 and 9 of Article 158 CRR. 98. In accordance with Article 155 CRR, institutions may employ different approaches (Simple Risk Weight approach, PD/LGD approach or Internal Models approach) to different portfolios when they use these different approaches internally. Institutions shall also report in the CR EQU IRB 1 template risk-weighted exposure amounts for those equity exposures which attract a fixed risk-weight treatment (without however being explicitly treated in accordance with the Simple Risk Weight approach or the (temporary or permanent) partial use of the credit risk Standardised approach).EN  .

This template requests information on both trading and non-trading book transactions which are unsettled after their due delivery dates, and their corresponding own funds requirements for settlement risk as referred to in point (c)(ii) of Article 92(3) and Article 378 CRR. 100. Institutions shall report in the CR SETT template information on the settlement/delivery risk in connection with debt instruments, equities, foreign currencies and commodities held in their trading or non-trading book.EN.   101. In accordance with Article 378 CRR, repurchase transactions, securities or commodities lending and securities or commodities borrowing in connection with debt instruments, equities, foreign currencies and commodities are not subject to own funds requirements for settlement/delivery risk. Note however that, derivatives and long settlement transactions unsettled after their due delivery dates shall nevertheless be subject to own funds requirements for settlement/delivery risk as determined in Article 378 CRR. 102. In case of unsettled transactions after the due delivery date, institutions shall calculate the price difference to which they are exposed. That is the difference between the agreed settlement price for the debt instrument, equity, foreign currency or commodity in question and its current market value, where the difference could involve a loss for the institution. 103. Institutions shall multiply that difference by the appropriate factor of Table 1 of Article 378 CRR to determine the corresponding own funds requirements. 104. In accordance with point (b) of Article 92(4) CRR, the own funds requirements for settlement/delivery risk shall be multiplied by 12,5 to calculate the risk exposure amount. 105. Note that own funds requirements for free deliveries as laid down in Article 379 CRR are not within the scope of the CR SETT template. Those own funds requirements shall be reported in the credit risk templates (CR SA, CR IRB)..

C – CREDIT RISK – SECURITISATIONS (CR SEC). General remarks 106. Where institution acts as originator, the information in this template shall be required for all securiti sations for which a significant risk transfer is recognised. Where the institution acts as investor, all exposures shall be reported. 107. The information to be reported shall be contingent on the role of the institution in the securitisation process. As such, specific reporting items shall be applicable for originators, sponsors and investors. 108. This template shall gather joint information on both traditional and synthetic securitisations held in the banking book.. Instructions concerning specific positions  TOTAL AMOUNT OF SECURITISATION EXPOSURES ORIGINATED Originator institutions shall report the outstanding amount at the reporting date of all current securitisation exposures originated in the securitisation transaction, irrespective of who holds the positions. As such, on-balance sheet securitisation exposures (e.g. bonds, subordinated loans) as well as off-balance sheet exposures and derivatives (e.g. subordinated credit lines, liquidity facilities, interest rate swaps, credit default swaps, etc.) that have been originated in the securitisation shall be reported. In case of traditional securitisations where the originator does not hold any position, the originator shall not consider that securitisation in the reporting of this template. For that purpose, securitisation positions held by the originator shall include early amortisation provi sions, as defined in Article 242(16) CRR, in a securitisation of revolving exposures. - SYNTHETIC SECURITISATIONS: CREDIT PROTECTION TO THE SECURITISED EXPOSURES Articles 251 and 252 CRR. Maturity mismatches shall not be taken into account in the adjusted value of the credit risk mitigation techniques involved in the securitisation structure.. FUNDED CREDIT PROTECTION (C VA) The detailed calculation procedure of the volatility-adjusted value of the collateral (C VA ) which shall be reported in this column is laid down in Article 223(2) CRR.. TOTAL OUTFLOWS: UNFUNDED CREDIT PROTECTION ADJUSTED VALUES (G*) Following the general rule for ‘inflows’ and ‘outflows’, the amounts reported under this column shall appear as ‘inflows’ in the corresponding credit risk template (CR SA or CR IRB) and exposure class to which the reporting entity allocates the protection provider (i.e. the third party to which the tranche is transferred by means of unfunded credit protection). The calculation procedure of the ‘foreign exchange risk’- adjusted nominal amount of the credit protection (G*) is laid down in Article 233(3) CRR.EN  .  NOTIONAL AMOUNT RETAINED OR REPURCHASED OF CREDIT PROTECTION All tranches which have been retained or bought back, e.g. retained first loss positions, shall be reported with their nominal amount. The effect of supervisory haircuts in the credit protection shall not be taken into account when computing the retained or repurchased amount of credit protection. SECURITISATION POSITIONS: ORIGINAL EXPOSURE PRE-CONVERSION FACTORS This column shall include the exposure values of securitisation positions held by the reporting institution, calculated in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 248 CRR, without applying credit conversion factors, gross of value adjustments and provisions, and any non- refundable purchase price discounts on the securitised exposures as referred to in point (d) of Article 248(1) CRR, and gross of value adjustments and provisions on the securitisation position. Netting shall only be relevant with respect to multiple derivative contracts provided to the same SSPE, covered by an eligible netting agreement. In synthetic securitisations, the positions held by the originator in the form of on-balance sheet items and/or investor’s interest shall be the result of the aggregation of columns to.. VALUE ADJUSTMENTS AND PROVISIONS Article 248 CRR. Value adjustments and provisions to be reported in this column shall only refer to securitisation positions. Value adjustments of securitised exposures shall not be considered. EXPOSURE NET OF VALUE ADJUSTMENTS AND PROVISIONS This column shall include the exposure values of securitisation positions calculated in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 248 CRR, net of value adjustments and provisions, without applying conversion factors and gross of any non-refundable purchase price discounts on the securitised exposures as referred to in point (d) of Article 248(1) CRR, and net of value adjustments and provisions on the securitisation position. - CREDIT RISK MITIGATION (CRM) TECHNIQUES WITH SUBSTITUTION EFFECTS ON THE EXPOSURE Point (57) of Article 4(1) CRR, Chapter 4 of Title II of Part Three CRR and Article 249 CRR Institutions shall report in these columns information on credit risk mitigation techniques that reduce the credit risk of an exposure or exposures via the substitution of exposures (as indicated below for Inflows and Outflows). Collateral that has an effect on the exposure value (e.g. if used for credit risk mitigation techniques with substitution effects on the exposure) shall be capped at the exposure value. Items to be reported here: 1. collateral, incorporated in accordance with Article 222 CRR (Financial Collateral Simple Method); 2. eligible unfunded credit protection.. UNFUNDED CREDIT PROTECTION: ADJUSTED VALUES (G A) Unfunded credit protection as defined in Article 4(1)(59), Articles 234 to 236 CRR.EN.   . FUNDED CREDIT PROTECTION Funded credit protection as defined in Article 4(1)(58) CRR, as referred to in the first subparagraph of Article 249(2) CRR and as regulated in Articles 195, 197 and 200 CRR.

TOTAL OUTFLOWS Article 222(3), paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 235 and Article 236 CRR. Outflows shall correspond to the covered part of the ‘Exposure net of value adjustments and provisions’ that is deducted from the obligor’s exposure class and, where relevant, risk weight or obligor grade, and subsequently assigned to the protection provider’s exposure class and, where relevant, risk weight or obligor grade. That amount shall be considered as an Inflow into the protection provider’s exposure class and, where relevant, risk weights or obligor grades. TOTAL INFLOWS Securitisation positions which are debt securities and are used as eligible financial collateral in accordance with Article 197(1) CRR and where the Financial Collateral Simple Method is used, shall be reported as inflows in this column. NET EXPOSURE AFTER CRM SUBSTITUTION EFFECTS PRE-CONVERSION FACTORS This column shall include the exposures assigned in the corresponding risk weight and exposure class after taking into account outflows and inflows due to ‘Credit risk mitigation (CRM) techniques with substitution effects on the exposure’..

SPECIFIC CREDIT RISK ADJUSTMENTS ON UNDERLYING EXPOSURES In accordance with point (d) of Article 248(1) CRR, an originator institution may deduct from the exposure value of a securitisation position, which is assigned a 1 250 % risk weight or is deducted from Common Equity Tier 1, the amount of the specific credit risk adjustments on the underlying exposures as determined in accordance with Article 110 CRR. EXPOSURE VALUE The exposure value of securitisation positions calculated in accordance with Article 248 CRR. EXPOSURE VALUE DEDUCTED FROM OWN FUNDS In accordance with point (b) of Article 244(1), point (b) of Article 245(1) and Article 253(1) CRR, in case of a securitisation position to which a 1 250 % risk weight applies, institutions may, as an alternative to including the position in their calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts, deduct from own funds the exposure value of the position. EXPOSURE VALUE SUBJECT TO RISK WEIGHTS Exposure value minus the exposure value deducted from own funds. SEC-IRBA Point (a) of Article 254(1) CRR - BREAKDOWN BY RW BANDS SEC-IRBA exposures broken down by risk-weight bands. OF WHICH: CALCULATED UNDER ARTICLE 255(4) (PURCHASED RECEIVABLES) Article 255(4) CRR For the purpose of this column, retail exposures shall be treated as purchased retail receivables and non-retail exposures as purchased corporate receivables. SEC-SA Point (b) of Article 254(1) CRREN.    - BREAKDOWN BY RW BANDS SEC-SA exposures broken down by risk-weight bands. For the RW = 1 250 % (W unknown), the fourth paragraph of point (b) of Article 261(2) CRR stipulates that the position in the securitisation shall be risk-weighted at 1 250 % where the institution does not know the delinquency status for more than 5 % of underlying exposures in the pool.

Institutions as originators, sponsors and original lenders shall report one of the following abbreviations: — ‘K’ if entirely recognised; — ‘P’ if partially derecognised; — ‘R’ if entirely derecognised; — ‘N’ if not applicable. This column summarises the accounting treatment of the transaction. Significant risk transfer (SRT) under Articles 244 and 245 CRR shall not affect the accounting treatment of the transaction under the relevant accounting framework.

Articles 109, 244 and 245 CRR Originators, only, shall report the following abbreviations: — ‘N’ not subject to own funds requirements; — ‘B’ banking book; — ‘T’ trading book; — ‘A’ partly in both books. This column shall summarise the solvency treatment of the securitisation scheme by the originator. It shall indicate whether own funds requirements are calculated on the basis of securitised exposures or securitisation positions (banking book/trading book). Where own funds requirements are based on securitised exposures (as no significant risk transfer was achieved) the calculation of own funds requirements for credit risk shall be reported in the CR SA template, for those securitised exposures for which the Standardised Approach is used, or in the CR IRB template for those securitised exposures for which the Internal Ratings Based Approach is used by the institution. Conversely, where own funds requirements are based on securitisation positions held in the banking book (as a significant risk transfer was achieved), the information on the calculation of own funds requirements for credit risk shall be reported in the CR SEC template. In case of securitisation positions held in the trading book , the information on the calculation of own funds requirements for market risk shall be reported in the MKR SA TDI (standardised general position risk) and in the MKR SA SEC or MKR SA CTP (standardised specific position risk) or in the MKR IM (internal models) templates.

Institutions shall report the following abbreviations: Y - Yes; N - No. This column shall not be reported where code ‘E’ (exempted) is reported under column (Type of retention applied). - NON ABCP PROGRAMMES Because of the special character of ABCP programmes resulting from the fact that they comprise several single securitisation positions, ABCP programmes (as defined in Article 242(11) CRR) shall be exempted from reporting in columns , and. ORIGINATION DATE (yyyy-mm-dd) The month and year of the origination date (i.e. cut-off or closing date of the pool) of the securitisation shall be reported in the following format: ‘mm/yyyy’. For each securitisation scheme, the origination date cannot change between reporting dates. In the particular case of securitisation schemes backed by open pools, the origination date shall be the date of the first issuance of securities.

In the case of multi-seller secu ritisation schemes (i.e. with more than one originator), only the amount corresponding to the reporting entity’s contribution in the securitised portfolio shall be reported. In the case of securitisation schemes backed by closed pools (i.e. the portfolio of securitised assets cannot be enlarged after the origination date), the amount will progressively be reduced. This information shall be reported even where the reporting entity does not hold any positions in the securitisation. INSTITUTION’S SHARE (%) Institution’s share (percentage with two decimals) at reporting date in the securitised portfolio.

C – CREDIT RISK – SECURITISATIONS (CR SEC). General remarks 106. Where institution acts as originator, the information in this template shall be required for all securiti sations for which a significant risk transfer is recognised. Where the institution acts as investor, all exposures shall be reported. 107. The information to be reported shall be contingent on the role of the institution in the securitisation process. As such, specific reporting items shall be applicable for originators, sponsors and investors. 108. This template shall gather joint information on both traditional and synthetic securitisations held in the banking book.. Instructions concerning specific positions  TOTAL AMOUNT OF SECURITISATION EXPOSURES ORIGINATED Originator institutions shall report the outstanding amount at the reporting date of all current securitisation exposures originated in the securitisation transaction, irrespective of who holds the positions. As such, on-balance sheet securitisation exposures (e.g. bonds, subordinated loans) as well as off-balance sheet exposures and derivatives (e.g. subordinated credit lines, liquidity facilities, interest rate swaps, credit default swaps, etc.) that have been originated in the securitisation shall be reported. In case of traditional securitisations where the originator does not hold any position, the originator shall not consider that securitisation in the reporting of this template. For that purpose, securitisation positions held by the originator shall include early amortisation provi sions, as defined in Article 242(16) CRR, in a securitisation of revolving exposures. - SYNTHETIC SECURITISATIONS: CREDIT PROTECTION TO THE SECURITISED EXPOSURES Articles 251 and 252 CRR. Maturity mismatches shall not be taken into account in the adjusted value of the credit risk mitigation techniques involved in the securitisation structure.. FUNDED CREDIT PROTECTION (C VA) The detailed calculation procedure of the volatility-adjusted value of the collateral (C VA ) which shall be reported in this column is laid down in Article 223(2) CRR.. TOTAL OUTFLOWS: UNFUNDED CREDIT PROTECTION ADJUSTED VALUES (G*) Following the general rule for ‘inflows’ and ‘outflows’, the amounts reported under this column shall appear as ‘inflows’ in the corresponding credit risk template (CR SA or CR IRB) and exposure class to which the reporting entity allocates the protection provider (i.e. the third party to which the tranche is transferred by means of unfunded credit protection). The calculation procedure of the ‘foreign exchange risk’- adjusted nominal amount of the credit protection (G*) is laid down in Article 233(3) CRR.EN  .  NOTIONAL AMOUNT RETAINED OR REPURCHASED OF CREDIT PROTECTION All tranches which have been retained or bought back, e.g. retained first loss positions, shall be reported with their nominal amount. The effect of supervisory haircuts in the credit protection shall not be taken into account when computing the retained or repurchased amount of credit protection. SECURITISATION POSITIONS: ORIGINAL EXPOSURE PRE-CONVERSION FACTORS This column shall include the exposure values of securitisation positions held by the reporting institution, calculated in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 248 CRR, without applying credit conversion factors, gross of value adjustments and provisions, and any non- refundable purchase price discounts on the securitised exposures as referred to in point (d) of Article 248(1) CRR, and gross of value adjustments and provisions on the securitisation position. Netting shall only be relevant with respect to multiple derivative contracts provided to the same SSPE, covered by an eligible netting agreement. In synthetic securitisations, the positions held by the originator in the form of on-balance sheet items and/or investor’s interest shall be the result of the aggregation of columns to.. VALUE ADJUSTMENTS AND PROVISIONS Article 248 CRR. Value adjustments and provisions to be reported in this column shall only refer to securitisation positions. Value adjustments of securitised exposures shall not be considered. EXPOSURE NET OF VALUE ADJUSTMENTS AND PROVISIONS This column shall include the exposure values of securitisation positions calculated in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 248 CRR, net of value adjustments and provisions, without applying conversion factors and gross of any non-refundable purchase price discounts on the securitised exposures as referred to in point (d) of Article 248(1) CRR, and net of value adjustments and provisions on the securitisation position. - CREDIT RISK MITIGATION (CRM) TECHNIQUES WITH SUBSTITUTION EFFECTS ON THE EXPOSURE Point (57) of Article 4(1) CRR, Chapter 4 of Title II of Part Three CRR and Article 249 CRR Institutions shall report in these columns information on credit risk mitigation techniques that reduce the credit risk of an exposure or exposures via the substitution of exposures (as indicated below for Inflows and Outflows). Collateral that has an effect on the exposure value (e.g. if used for credit risk mitigation techniques with substitution effects on the exposure) shall be capped at the exposure value. Items to be reported here: 1. collateral, incorporated in accordance with Article 222 CRR (Financial Collateral Simple Method); 2. eligible unfunded credit protection.. UNFUNDED CREDIT PROTECTION: ADJUSTED VALUES (G A) Unfunded credit protection as defined in Article 4(1)(59), Articles 234 to 236 CRR.EN.   . FUNDED CREDIT PROTECTION Funded credit protection as defined in Article 4(1)(58) CRR, as referred to in the first subparagraph of Article 249(2) CRR and as regulated in Articles 195, 197 and 200 CRR. Credit linked notes and on-balance sheet netting as referred to in Articles 218 and 219 CRR shall be treated as cash collateral. - SUBSTITUTION OF THE EXPOSURE DUE TO CRM: Inflows and outflows within the same exposure classes and, when relevant, risk weights or obligor grades shall be reported.. TOTAL OUTFLOWS Article 222(3), paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 235 and Article 236 CRR. Outflows shall correspond to the covered part of the ‘Exposure net of value adjustments and provisions’ that is deducted from the obligor’s exposure class and, where relevant, risk weight or obligor grade, and subsequently assigned to the protection provider’s exposure class and, where relevant, risk weight or obligor grade. That amount shall be considered as an Inflow into the protection provider’s exposure class and, where relevant, risk weights or obligor grades. TOTAL INFLOWS Securitisation positions which are debt securities and are used as eligible financial collateral in accordance with Article 197(1) CRR and where the Financial Collateral Simple Method is used, shall be reported as inflows in this column. NET EXPOSURE AFTER CRM SUBSTITUTION EFFECTS PRE-CONVERSION FACTORS This column shall include the exposures assigned in the corresponding risk weight and exposure class after taking into account outflows and inflows due to ‘Credit risk mitigation (CRM) techniques with substitution effects on the exposure’..

For reporting purposes, fully adjusted exposure values (E*) shall be reported for the 0 % conversion factor. (-)NON REFUNDABLE PURCHASE PRICE DISCOUNT In accordance with point (d) of Article 248(1) CRR, an originator institution may deduct from the exposure value of a securitisation position which is assigned a 1 250 % risk weight any non-refundable purchase price discounts connected with such underlying exposures to the extent that such discounts have caused the reduction of own funds.. SPECIFIC CREDIT RISK ADJUSTMENTS ON UNDERLYING EXPOSURES In accordance with point (d) of Article 248(1) CRR, an originator institution may deduct from the exposure value of a securitisation position, which is assigned a 1 250 % risk weight or is deducted from Common Equity Tier 1, the amount of the specific credit risk adjustments on the underlying exposures as determined in accordance with Article 110 CRR. EXPOSURE VALUE The exposure value of securitisation positions calculated in accordance with Article 248 CRR. EXPOSURE VALUE DEDUCTED FROM OWN FUNDS In accordance with point (b) of Article 244(1), point (b) of Article 245(1) and Article 253(1) CRR, in case of a securitisation position to which a 1 250 % risk weight applies, institutions may, as an alternative to including the position in their calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts, deduct from own funds the exposure value of the position. EXPOSURE VALUE SUBJECT TO RISK WEIGHTS Exposure value minus the exposure value deducted from own funds. SEC-IRBA Point (a) of Article 254(1) CRR - BREAKDOWN BY RW BANDS SEC-IRBA exposures broken down by risk-weight bands. OF WHICH: CALCULATED UNDER ARTICLE 255(4) (PURCHASED RECEIVABLES) Article 255(4) CRR For the purpose of this column, retail exposures shall be treated as purchased retail receivables and non-retail exposures as purchased corporate receivables. SEC-SA Point (b) of Article 254(1) CRREN.    - BREAKDOWN BY RW BANDS SEC-SA exposures broken down by risk-weight bands. For the RW = 1 250 % (W unknown), the fourth paragraph of point (b) of Article 261(2) CRR stipulates that the position in the securitisation shall be risk-weighted at 1 250 % where the institution does not know the delinquency status for more than 5 % of underlying exposures in the pool.

This template provides information on the calculation of own funds requirements in accordance with Articles 312 to 324 CRR for Operational Risk under the Basic Indicator Approach (BIA), the Standardised Approach (TSA), the Alternative Standardised Approach (ASA) and the Advanced Measurement Approaches (AMA). An institution cannot apply TSA and ASA for the business lines retail banking and commercial banking at the same time at solo level. 137. Institutions using the BIA, TSA or ASA shall calculate their own funds requirement, based on the information at financial year-end. Where audited figures are not available, institutions may use business estimates. Where audited figures are used, institutions shall report the audited figures which are expected to remain unchanged. Deviations from this ‘unchanged’ principle are possible, for instance if during that period the exceptional circumstances, such as recent acquisitions or disposals of entities or activities, are met. 138. Where an institution can justify its competent authority that – due to exceptional circumstances such as a merger or a disposal of entities or activities – using a three year average to calculating the relevant indicator would lead to a biased estimation for the own funds requirement for operational risk, the competent authority may permit the institution to modify the calculation in a way that would take into account such events. The competent authority may also on its own initiative require an institution to modify the calculation. An institution that has been in operation for less than three years may use forward looking business estimates in calculating the relevant indicator, provided that it starts using historical data as soon as those data are available.EN.   139. By columns, this template presents information, for the three most recent years, on the amount of the relevant indicator of the banking activities subject to operational risk and on the amount of loans and advances (the latter only applicable in the case of ASA). Next, information on the amount of own funds requirement for operational risk is reported. Where applicable, it must be detailed which part of that amount is due to an allocation mechanism. Regarding AMA, memorandum items are added to present a detail of the effect of the expected loss, diversification and mitigation techniques on own funds requirement for operational risk. 140. By rows, information is presented by method of calculation of the operational risk own funds requirement detailing business lines for TSA and ASA. 141. This template shall be submitted by all institutions subject to operational risk own funds requirement.. Instructions concerning specific positions  - RELEVANT INDICATOR Institutions using the relevant indicator to calculate the own funds requirement for operational risk (BIA, TSA and ASA) shall report the relevant indicator for the respective years in columns to. Moreover, in case of a combined use of different approaches as referred in Article 314 CRR, institutions shall also report, for information purposes, relevant the indicator for the activities subject to AMA. The same shall apply for all other AMA banks. Hereafter, the term ‘relevant indicator’ refers to ‘the sum of the elements’ at the end of the financial year as referred to in point 1 in Table 1 of Article 316 CRR. Where the institution has less than 3 years of data on ‘relevant indicator’ available, the available historical data (audited figures) shall be assigned by priority to the corresponding columns in the template. Where, for instance, historical data for only one year is available, those data shall be reported in column. Where it seems reasonable, the forward looking estimates shall be included in column (estimate of next year) and column (estimate of year +2). Furthermore, where there are no historical data on ‘relevant indicator’ available, the institution may use forward-looking business estimates. - LOANS AND ADVANCES (IN THE CASE OF ASA APPLICATION) These columns shall be used to report the amounts of the loans and advances, as referred to in point (b) of Article 319(1) CRR, for business lines ‘commercial banking’ and ‘retail banking’. Those amounts shall be used to calculate the alternative relevant indicator that leads to the own funds requirements corresponding to the activities subject to the alternative standard approach (point (a) of Article 319(1) CRR). For the ‘commercial banking’ business line, securities held in the non-trading book shall also be included. OWN FUND REQUIREMENT The own fund requirement shall be calculated in accordance with the approaches used and in accordance withArticles 312 to 324 CRR. The resulting amount shall be reported in column. TOTAL OPERATIONAL RISK EXPOSURE AMOUNT Article 92(4) CRR Own funds requirements in column multiplied by. EN  .  OF WHICH: DUE TO AN ALLOCATION MECHANISM Where a permission to use the AMA at consolidated level (Article 18(1) CRR) has been granted in accordance with Article 312(2) CRR, operational risk capital shall be allocated between the different entities of the group on the basis of the methodology applied by the institutions to consider diversification effects in the risk measurement system used by a EU parent credit institution and its subsidiaries or jointly by the subsidiaries of an EU parent financial holding company or an EU parent mixed financial holding company. The result of that allocation shall be reported in this column. - AMA MEMORANDUM ITEMS TO BE REPORTED IF APPLICABLE OWN FUNDS REQUIREMENT BEFORE ALLEVIATION DUE TO EXPECTED LOSS, DIVERSIFI CATION AND RISK MITIGATION TECHNIQUES The own funds requirement reported in column 090 is the one of column 070 but calculated before taking into account the alleviation effects due to expected loss, diversification and risk mitigation techniques (see below).. ALLEVIATION OF OWN FUNDS REQUIREMENTS DUE TO THE EXPECTED LOSS CAPTURED IN BUSINESS PRACTICES In column 100, the alleviation of own funds requirements due to expected loss captured in internal business practices (as referred to in point (a) of Article 322(2) CRR) shall reported.. ALLEVIATION OF OWN FUNDS REQUIREMENTS DUE TO DIVERSIFICATION The diversification effect reported in this column shall be the difference between the sum of own funds requirements calculated separately for each operational risk class (i.e. a ‘perfect dependence’ situation) and the diversified own funds requirement calculated by taking into account correlations and dependencies (i.e. assuming less than ‘perfect dependence’ between the risk classes). The ‘perfect dependence’ situation occurs in the ‘default case’, that is where the institution does not use explicit correlations structure between the risk classes, hence the AMA capital is calculated as the sum of the individual operational risk measures of the chosen risk classes. In that case, the correlation between the risk classes is assumed to be 100 % and the value in the column has to be set to zero. Conversely, where the institution calculates an explicit correlations structure between risk classes, it has to include in this column the difference between the AMA capital as stemming from the ‘default case’ and the AMA capital obtained after applying the correlations structure between the risk classes. The value reflects the ‘diversification capacity’ of the AMA model, that is the ability of the model to capture the not simultaneous occurrence of severe operational risk loss events. In column 110, the amount by which the assumed correlation structure decreases the AMA capital relative to the assumption of 100 % correlation has to be reported.. ALLEVIATION OF OWN FUNDS REQUIREMENT DUE TO RISK MITIGATION TECHNIQUES (INSURANCE AND OTHER RISK TRANSFER MECHANISMS) The impact of insurance and other risk transfer mechanisms as referred to in Article 323 CRR shall be reported in this column. Rows BANKING ACTIVITIES SUBJECT TO BASIC INDICATOR APPROACH (BIA) This row shall present the amounts corresponding to activities subject to the BIA to calculate the own funds requirement for operational risk (Articles 315 and 316 CRR).EN.   Rows BANKING ACTIVITIES SUBJECT TO STANDARISED (TSA)/ALTERNATIVE STANDARDISED (ASA) APPROACHES The own funds requirement calculated in accordance with the TSA and ASA (Articles 317, 318 and 319 CRR) shall be reported. - SUBJECT TO TSA Where the TSA is used, the relevant indicator for each respective year shall be distributed in rows to amongst the business lines referred to in Table 2 of Article 317 CRR. The mapping of activities into business lines shall follow the principles described in Article 318 CRR. - SUBJECT TO ASA Institutions using the ASA (Article 319 CRR) shall report for the respective years the relevant indicator separately for each business line in rows to and to and in rows and for business lines ‘commercial banking’ and ‘retail banking’. Rows 110 and 120 shall present the amount of the relevant indicator of activities subject to ASA, distinguishing between the amount corresponding to the business line ‘commercial banking’ and the amounts corresponding to the business line ‘retail banking’ (Article 319 CRR). There can be amounts for the rows corresponding to ‘commercial banking’ and ‘retail banking’ under the TSA (rows and ) as well as under the ASA rows and (e.g. if a subsidiary is subject to TSA whereas the parent entity is subject to ASA). BANKING ACTIVITIES SUBJECT TO ADVANCED MEASUREMENT APPROACHES AMA The relevant data for AMA institutions (Article 312(2) and Articles 321, 322 and 323 CRR) shall be reported. Where different approaches are combined as indicated in Article 314 CRR, information on relevant indicator for activities subject to AMA shall be reported. The same shall apply for all other AMA banks.EN  .

MARKET RISK TEMPLATES 158. These instructions refer to the templates for the reporting of the calculation of own funds requirements in accordance with the Standardised Approach for foreign exchange risk (MKR SA FX), commodities risk (MKR SA COM), interest rate risk (MKR SA TDI, MKR SA SEC, MKR SA CTP) and equity risk (MKR SA EQU). Additionally, instructions for the template for the reporting of the calculation of own funds requirements in accordance with the internal models approach (MKR IM) are included in this part. 159. The position risk on a traded debt instrument or equity (or debt or equity derivative) shall be divided into two components in order to calculate the capital required against it. The first shall be its specific-risk component – that is the risk of a price change in the instrument concerned due to factors related to its issuer or, in the case of a derivative, the issuer of the underlying instrument. The second component shall cover its general risk – that is the risk of a price change in the instrument due (in the case of a traded debt instrument or debt derivative) to a change in the level of interest rates or (in the case of an equity or equity derivative) to a broad equity- market movement unrelated to any specific attributes of individual securities.

This template provides a breakdown of VaR and stressed VaR (sVaR) figures by the different market risks (debt, equity, FX, commodities) and other information relevant for the calculation of the own funds requirements. 175. Generally, it depends on the structure of the model of the institutions whether the figures for general and specific risk can be determined and reported separately or only as a total. The same holds true for the decomposition of the VaR/Stress-VaR into the risk categories (interest rate risk, equity risk, commodities risk and foreign exchange risk). An institution can refrain from reporting those decompositions if it proves that reporting those figures would be unduly burdensome..

This template shall be completed by all institutions that: (a) are required to use the core approach because they exceed the threshold referred to in Article 4(1) of Delegated Regulation (EU) /101, either on an individual basis or on a consolidated basis as set out in Article 4(3) of that Regulation; or (b) have chosen to apply the core approach despite not exceeding the threshold. 180. For the purposes of this template, ‘upside uncertainty’ shall mean the following: As determined by Article 8(2) of Delegated Regulation (EU) /101, AVAs are calculated as the difference between the fair value and a prudent valuation that is determined on the basis of a 90 % confidence that institutions can exit the exposure at that point or better within the notional range of plausible values. The upside value or ‘upside uncertainty’ is the opposing point in the distribution of plausible values at which institutions are only 10 % confident that they can exit the position at that point or better. The upside uncertainty shall be calculated and aggregated on the same basis as the total AVA but substituting a 10 % level of certainty for the 90 % used when determining the total AVA.. Instructions concerning specific positions  – CATEGORY LEVEL AVA The category level AVAs for market price uncertainty, close-out costs, model risk, concen trated positions, future administrative costs, early termination and operational risk are calculated as described in Articles 9, 10, 11 and 14 to 17 of Delegated Regulation (EU) /101 respectively. For the market price uncertainty, close-out cost and model risk categories, which are subject to diversification benefit as set out in Articles 9(6), 10(7) and 11(7) of Delegated Regulation (EU) /101, respectively, category level AVAs shall be, unless indicated otherwise, reported as the straight sum of the individual AVAs before diversification benefit [since diversification benefits calculated using method 1 or method 2 of the Annex of Delegated Regulation (EU) /101 are reported in items , and of the template]. For the market uncertainty, close-out cost and model risk categories, amounts calculated under the expert-based approach as referred to in point (b) of Article 9(5), point (b) of Article 10(6) and Article 11(4) of Delegated Regulation (EU) /101 shall be separately reported in columns , and.

Unadjusted difference amounts refer to unadjusted differences between the trading system generated valuations and the valuations assessed during the monthly IPV process. No adjusted difference amounts in the books and records of the institution for the relevant month end date shall be included in the calculation of IPV difference.EN  .  – FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS Adjustments, sometimes also referred to as ‘reserves’, potentially applied in the institution’s accounting fair value that are made outside of the valuation model used to generate carrying amounts (excluding deferral of day one gains and losses) and that can be identified as addressing the same source of valuation uncertainty as the relevant AVA. They could reflect risk factors not captured within the valuation technique that are in a form of a risk premium or exit cost and are compliant with the definition of fair value. They shall nevertheless be considered by market participants when setting a price. (IFRS and IFRS13.88) MARKET PRICE UNCERTAINTY Adjustment applied in the institution’s fair value to reflect the risk premium arising from the existence of a range of observed prices for equivalent instruments or, in respect of a market parameter input to a valuation model, the instruments from which the input has been calibrated, and thus that can be identified as addressing the same source of valuation uncer tainty as the Market price uncertainty AVA. CLOSE-OUT COSTS Adjustment applied in the institution’s fair value to adjust for the fact that the position level valuations do not reflect an exit price for the position or portfolio, in particular where such valuations are calibrated to a mid-market price, and thus that can be identified as addressing the same source of valuation uncertainty as the close-out costs AVA. MODEL RISK Adjustment applied in the institution’s fair value to reflect market or product factors that are not captured by the model used to calculate daily position values and risks (‘valuation model’) or to reflect an appropriate level of prudence given the uncertainty arising from the existence of a range of alternative valid models and model calibrations and thus that can be identified as addressing the same source of valuation uncertainty as the model risk AVA. CONCENTRATED POSITIONS Adjustment applied in the institution’s fair value to reflect the fact that the aggregate position held by the institution is larger than normal traded volume or larger than the position sizes on which observable quotes or trades that are used to calibrate the price or inputs used by the valuation model are based and thus can be identified as addressing the same source of valuation uncertainty as the concentrated positions AVA. UNEARNED CREDIT SPREADS Adjustment applied in the institution’s fair value to cover expected losses due to counterparty default on derivative positions (i.e. total Credit Valuation Adjustment ‘CVA’ at institution level). INVESTING AND FUNDING COSTS Adjustment applied in the institution’s fair value to compensate where valuation models do not fully reflect the funding cost that market participants would factor into the exit price for a position or portfolio (i.e. total Funding Valuation Adjustment at institution level where an institution computes such adjustment, or alternatively, equivalent adjustment).EN.    FUTURE ADMINISTRATION COSTS Adjustment applied in the institution’s fair value to reflect administrative costs that are incurred by the portfolio or position but are not reflected in the valuation model or the prices used to calibrate inputs to that model, and thus that can be identified as addressing the same source of valuation uncertainty as the Future administrative costs AVA. EARLY TERMINATION Adjustments applied in the institution’s fair value to reflect contractual or non-contractual early termination expectations that are not reflected in the valuation model and thus can be identified as addressing the same source of valuation uncertainty as the Early termination AVA. OPERATIONAL RISK Adjustments applied in the institution’s fair value to reflect the risk premium that market participants would charge to compensate for operational risks arising from hedging, adminis tration and settlement of contracts in the portfolio, and thus can be identified as addressing the same source of valuation uncertainty as the operational risk AVA. DAY 1 P&L Adjustments to reflect instances where the valuation model plus all other relevant fair value adjustments applicable to a position or portfolio did not reflect the price paid or received at first day recognition, i.e. the deferral of day one gains and losses (IFRS 9.B5..A).

To that end, institutions shall rely on their internal risk management structure and, following a mapping developed based on expert judgement, allocate their business lines or trading desks to the most appropriate risk category. AVAs, Fair Value Adjustments and other required information which correspond to the allocated business lines or trading desks, shall be allocated to the same relevant risk category to provide at row level for each risk category a consistent overview of the adjustments performed both for prudential purposes and accounting purposes, as well as an indication of the size of the positions concerned (in terms of fair-valued assets and liabilities). Where AVAs or other adjustments are computed at a different level of aggregation, in particular at firm level, institutions shall develop an allocation methodology of the AVAs to the relevant sets of positions. The allocation methodology shall lead to row being the sum of rows to for columns to. Regardless of the approach applied, the information reported shall, as much as possible, be consistent at row level, since the information provided will be compared at this level (AVA amounts, upside uncertainty, fair-value amounts and potential fair-value adjustments).

C – EXPOSURES TO GENERAL GOVERNMENTS (GOV). GENERAL REMARKS 191. The information for the purpose of template C shall cover all exposures to ‘General governments’ as referred to in point (b) of paragraph 42 of Annex V to this Implementing Regulation. 192. Where the exposures to ‘General governments’ are subject to own funds requirements in accordance with Title II of Part Three CRR, exposures to ‘General governments’ are included in different exposure classes in accordance with Article 112 and Article 147 CRR, as specified by the instructions for the completion of template C , C and C. 193. Table 2 (Standardised Approach) and Table 3 (IRB Approach), included in Part 3 of Annex V to this Implementing Regulation, shall be observed for the mapping of exposure classes used to calculate capital requirements under CRR to counterparty sector ‘General governments’. 194. Information shall be reported for the total aggregate exposures (meaning the sum of all countries in which the bank has sovereign exposures) and for each country on the basis of the residence of the counterparty on an immediate borrower basis. 195. The allocation of exposures to exposure classes or jurisdictions shall be made without considering credit mitigation techniques and in particular without considering substitution effects. However, the calculation of exposure values and risk weighted exposure amounts for each exposure class and each jurisdiction shall include the incidence of credit risk mitigation techniques, including substitution effects. 196. The reporting of information on exposures to ‘General governments’ by jurisdiction of residence of the immediate counterparty other than the domestic jurisdiction of the reporting institution is subject to the thresholds laid down in Article 6(3) of this Implementing Regulation.EN  ..  SCOPE OF THE TEMPLATE ON EXPOSURES TO ‘GENERAL GOVERNMENTS’ 197. The scope of the GOV template covers on-balance sheet, off-balance sheet and derivatives direct exposures to ‘General governments’ in the banking and trading book. In addition, a memorandum item on indirect exposures in the form of credit derivatives sold on general government exposures is also requested. 198. An exposure is a direct exposure when the immediate counterparty is an entity that is a ‘General government’ as referred to in point (b) of paragraph 42 of Annex V to this Implementing Regulation. 199. The template is divided in two sections. The first one is based on a breakdown of exposures by risk, regulatory approach and exposure classes whereas a second one is based on a breakdown by residual maturity. INSTRUCTIONS CONCERNING SPECIFIC POSITIONS  Instructions - DIRECT EXPOSURES - ON-BALANCE SHEET EXPOSURES Total gross carrying amount of non-derivative financial assets Aggregate of gross carrying amount, as determined in accordance with paragraph 34 of Part 1 of Annex V to this Implementing Regulation, of non-derivative financial assets to General governments, for all accounting portfolios under IFRS or national GAAP based on BAD defined in paragraphs 15 to 22 of Part 1 of Annex V to this Implementing Regulation, and listed in columns to Prudent valuation adjustments shall not reduce the gross carrying amount of trading and non- trading exposures measured at fair value.

Where the institution has a short position for the same residual maturity and the same immediate counterparty that is denominated in the same currency, the carrying amount of the short position shall be netted against the carrying amount of the direct position. That net amount shall be considered to be zero when it is a negative amount. Where an institution has a short position without a matching direct position, the amount of the short position shall be considered zero for the purposes of this column. - NON-DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL ASSETS BY ACCOUNTING PORTFOLIOS Aggregate carrying amount of non-derivative financial assets, as defined in the row above of this table, to General governments, broken down by accounting portfolio under the applicable accounting framework.

For the purpose of completing this template, institutions shall report the total amount of funding received from each product type which exceeds a threshold of 1 % of total liabilities. 3. For each product type, institutions shall report all of the columns 010 to 050. 4. The 1 % of total liabilities threshold shall be used to determine those product types from which funding has been obtained in accordance with the following: (a) the 1 % of total liabilities threshold shall be applied for the product types referred to in all of the following rows: ‘Sight deposit’; ‘Term deposits not withdrawable within the following 30 days’; ‘Term deposits within the following 30 days’; ‘Saving accounts’; ‘Unsecured wholesale funding’; ‘Secured wholesale funding’; (b) with regard to the calculation of the 1 % of total liabilities threshold for row ‘Saving accounts’ the threshold shall apply on the sum of and ; (c) for rows 1. ‘Retail Funding’ and 2. ‘Wholesale Funding’ the 1 % of total liabilities threshold applies on aggregated level only. 5.

Institutions shall report the information about the transaction volume and prices paid by institutions for funding obtained during the reporting period and still present at the end of the reporting period in template C in accordance with the following original maturities: — overnight in columns 010 and 020; — greater than overnight and less than or equal to 1 week (columns 030 and 040); — greater than 1 week and less than or equal to 1 month in columns 050 and 060; — greater than 1 month and less than or equal to 3 months in columns 070 and 080; — greater than 3 months and less than or equal to 6 months in columns 090 and 100; — greater than 6 months and less than or equal to 1 year in columns 110 and 120;EN L 97/ . — greater than 1 year and less than or equal to 2 years in columns 130 and 140; — greater than 2 years and less than or equal to 5 years in columns 150 and 160; — greater than 5 years and less than or equal to 10 years in columns 170 and 180. In case of currency revaluations, no new funding is obtained in the original currency and the reporting institution has not paid anything beyond the original price at the initial deposit of the funds. Thus, a positive increment caused by the currency revaluation shall not be reported in this template. 2. For the purposes of determining the maturity of the funding obtained, institutions shall ignore the period between trade date and settlement date, e.g. a three-month liability settling in two weeks’ time shall be reported in the 3 months maturity (columns 070 and 080). 3. The spread reported in the left hand column of each time bucket shall be one of the following: (a) the spread payable by the institution for liabilities less than or equal to one year, if they were to have been swapped to the benchmark overnight index for the appropriate currency no later than close of business on the day of the transaction; (b) the spread payable by the firm at issuance for liabilities with an original maturity greater than one year, were they to be swapped to the relevant benchmark index for the appropriate currency which is three month EURIBOR for EUR or a similar index for other currencies, no later than close of business on the day of the transaction. Solely for the purposes of spread calculation under points a) and b) above, on the basis of historical experience, the institution may determine the original maturity with or without taking into account optionality, as appropriate. 4. Spreads shall be reported in basis points with a negative sign in case the new funding is cheaper than under the relevant benchmark rate. They shall be calculated on a weighted average basis. 5. For the purposes of calculating the average spread payable across multiple issuances/deposits/loans, institutions shall calculate the total cost in the currency of issue ignoring any FX swap, but they shall include any premium or discount and fees payable or receivable, taking as a basis the term of any theoretical or actual interest rate swap matching the term of the liability. The spread shall be the liability rate minus the swap rate. 6. The amount of funding obtained for the funding categories listed in the ‘Item’ column shall be reported in the ‘volume’ column of the applicable time bucket. 7. In the column ‘volume’, institutions shall provide the amounts representing the carrying amount of the new funding obtained in the applicable time bucket in accordance with original maturity. 8. As for all items, also for off-balance sheet commitments, institutions shall only report the related amounts reflected in the balance sheet. An off-balance sheet commitment provided to the institution shall only be reported in C after a drawdown. In the case of a drawdown, the volume and spread to be reported shall be the amount drawn and applicable spread at the end of the reporting period. Where the drawdown cannot be rolled-over at the discretion of the institution, the actual maturity of the drawdown shall be reported. Where the institution has already drawn on the facility at the end of the previous reporting period, and where the institution subsequently increases the usage of the facility, only the additional amount drawn shall be reported. 9. Deposits placed by retail customers shall consist of deposits as defined in Article 3(8) of Delegated Regulation (EU) /61. 10. For funding that has rolled-over during the reporting period that is still outstanding at the end of the reporting period the average of spreads applying at that time (i.e. end of reporting period) shall be reported. For the purposes of C , funding that rolled-over and is still there at the end of the reporting period shall be considered to represent new funding.EN.  L 97/ 11. By way of deviation from the rest of Section , the volume and spread of sight deposits shall only be reported where the depositor did not have a sight deposit in the preceding reporting period or where there is an increase in the deposit amount compared to the previous reference date, in which case the increment shall be treated as new funding. The spread shall be that of the end of the period. 12. Where there is nothing to report, cells relating to spreads shall be left empty. 13.

Where the maturity of the funding has changed due to the roll-over event, the ‘roll-over’ amount shall be reported in a time bucket in accordance with the new maturity. 10. The ‘New funds’ amount shall comprise actual inflows of funding on the relevant day in the reporting period. It shall always be reported with a positive sign. 11. The ‘Net’ amount shall be considered as a change of funding within a particular original maturity time band on the relevant day of the reporting period, and shall be calculated by adding in the ‘net’ column the new funds plus the roll over funds minus the maturing funds. 12.

The counterbalancing capacity in C shall be the same as that in C with the qualification that the assets reported as counterbalancing capacity for the purposes of C shall be unencumbered to be available for the institution to convert into cash on the reporting reference date. 4. For calculating the concentrations for the purpose of reporting template C by significant currency, institutions shall use the concentrations in all currencies. 5. When an issuer or counterparty belongs to several groups of connected clients, it shall be reported only once in the group with the higher counterbalancing capacity concentration. 6. Except for row 120, concentrations of counterbalancing capacity with a central bank as issuer or counterparty shall not be reported in this template. In the event that an institution has pre-positioned assets at a central bank for standard liquidity operations and to the extent that these assets fall under the top ten issuers or counterparties of unencumbered counterbalancing capacity, the institution shall report the original issuer and the original product type.

BREAKDOWN OF FINANCIAL ASSETS BY INSTRUMENT AND BY COUNTERPARTY SECTOR (4) 67. Financial assets shall be broken down by accounting portfolio and instrument and – where required – by counterparty. For debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income and at amortised cost, the gross carrying amount of assets and accumulated impairments shall be broken down by impairment stages, except where they are purchased or originated financial assets that are credit-impaired at initial recognition as defined in IFRS 9 Appendix A. For these assets, the gross carrying amount and accumulated impairment shall be separately reported, outside the impairment stages, in templates and. 68. Derivatives reported as trading financial assets under GAAP based on BAD include instruments measured at fair value as well as instruments measured at cost-based methods or LOCOM.EN L 97/ . 69. For the purposes of Annexes III and IV as well as this Annex, ‘accumulated negative changes in fair value due to credit risk’ means, for non-performing exposures, accumulated changes in fair value due to credit risk where the accumulated net change is negative. The accumulated net change in fair value due to credit risk shall be calculated by adding all negative and positive changes in fair value due to credit risk that have occurred since recognition of the debt instrument. That amount shall only be reported where the addition of positive and negative changes in fair value due to credit risk results in a negative amount. The valuation of the debt instruments shall be performed on the level of single financial instruments. For each debt instrument, ‘Accumulated negative changes in fair value due to credit risk’ shall be reported until the derecognition of the instrument. 70. For the purposes of Annexes III and IV as well as this Annex, ‘accumulated impairment’ shall have the following meaning: (a) for debt instruments measured at amortised cost or at a cost-based method, that are not purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets, accumulated impairment is the cumulative amount of impairment losses, net of use and reversals that has been recognised, where appropriate for each of the impairment stages. Accumulated impairment reduces the carrying amount of the debt instrument through the use of an allowance account under IFRS and national GAAP based on BAD, or via direct reductions that do not constitute a derecognition event under national GAAP based on BAD; (b) for debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income under IFRS that are not purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets, accumulated impairment is the sum of expected credit losses and their variations recognised as a reduction of fair value on a given instrument since initial recognition; (c) for debt instruments at fair value through equity under national GAAP based on BAD subject to impairment, accumulated impairment is the cumulative amount of impairment losses, net of use and reversals that has been recognised. The reduction in the carrying amount is either made through use of an allowance account or via direct reductions that do not constitute a derecognition event. (d) for purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets, the initial estimate of lifetime expected credit losses is incorporated into the calculation of the credit-adjusted effective interest rate and accumulated impairment is the sum of subsequent changes in lifetime expected credit losses since initial recognition that are recognized as a variation of carrying amount/fair value on a given instrument. Accumulated impairment for purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets can be positive in case of impairment gains exceeding any previously recognised impairment losses (IFRS ). 71. Under IFRS, accumulated impairment shall include the allowance for expected credit losses for financial assets under each of the impairment stages specified by IFRS 9 and the allowance for purchased or originated credit- impaired financial assets. Under national GAAP based on BAD, it shall include specific and general allowance for credit risk, as well as the general allowance for banking risk where it reduces the carrying amount of debt instruments. Accumulated impairment shall also include the credit risk-induced value adjustments on financial assets under LOCOM. 72. ‘Accumulated partial write-offs’ and ‘Accumulated total write-offs’ shall include, respectively, the accumulated partial and total amount as at the reference date of principal and accrued past due interest and fees of any debt instrument that has been de-recognised to date using either of the methods described in paragraph 74 because the institution has no reasonable expectations of recovering the contractual cash flows. Those amounts shall be reported until the total extinguishment of all the reporting institution’s rights by expiry of the statute-of-limitations period, forgiveness or other causes, or until recovery. Therefore, where the written-off amounts are not recovered, they shall be reported while they are subject to enforcement activities.EN.  L 97/ 73. Where a debt instrument is eventually totally written-off because of successive partial write-offs, the cumu lative amount written-off shall be reclassified from the ‘Accumulated partial write-offs’ into the ‘Accumulated total write-offs’ column. 74. Write-offs shall constitute a derecognition event and relate to a financial asset in its entirety or to a portion of it, including where the modification of an asset leads the institution to give up its right of collecting cash flows on a portion or the entirety of this asset as further explained in paragraph 72. Write-offs shall include amounts caused by both reductions of the carrying amount of financial assets recognised directly in profit or loss and reductions in the amounts of the allowance accounts for credit losses taken against the carrying amount of financial assets. 75. The column ‘of which: Instruments with low credit risk’ shall include instruments that are determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date and for which the institution assumes that the credit risk has not increased significantly since initial recognition in accordance with IFRS. 76. Trade receivables within the meaning of IAS (h), contract assets and lease receivables for which the simplified approach of IFRS for the estimation of loss allowances has been applied, shall be reported within loans and advances in template. The corresponding loss allowance for those assets that are not purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets shall be reported in either ‘Accumulated impairment on assets with significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition but not credit-impaired (Stage 2)’ or ‘Accumulated impairment on credit-impaired assets (Stage 3)’, depending on whether trade receivables, contract assets or lease receivables under the simplified approach are considered as credit-impaired assets. 78. In template , institutions shall report the carrying amount of ‘Loans and advances’ and ‘Debt securities’ that fall within the definition of ‘subordinated debt’ in paragraph 100 of this Part. 79. In template , information to be reported depends on whether Non-trading non-derivative financial assets measured at fair value to equity can be subject to impairment requirements in application of the national GAAP based on BAD. Where those financial assets are subject to impairment, institutions shall report information in this template that relates to the carrying amount, the gross carrying amount of unimpaired assets and impaired assets, accumulated impairment and accumulated write-offs. Where those financial assets are not subject to impairment, institutions shall report the accumulated negative changes in fair value due to credit risk for non-performing exposures. 80. In template , financial assets measured under moderate LOCOM and their associated value adjustments shall be identified separately from other financial assets measured at a cost-based method and their associated impairment. Financial assets under a cost-based method, including financial assets under moderate LOCOM, shall be reported as unimpaired assets where they have no value adjustments or impairment associated with them, and as impaired assets in case they have value adjustments that qualify as impairment or impairment associated with them. Value adjustments that qualify as impairment shall be credit risk-induced value adjustments reflecting the deterioration of the creditworthiness of the counterparty. Financial assets under moderate LOCOM with market-risk induced value adjustments reflecting the impact of changes in the market conditions on the value of the asset shall not be considered as impaired. Accumulated credit-risk induced and market-risk induced value adjustments shall be reported separately. 81. In template , assets measured at strict LOCOM as well as their associated value adjustments shall be reported separately from assets under other measurement methods. Financial assets under strict LOCOM and financial assets under other measurement methods shall be reported as impaired assets in case they have credit-risk induced value adjustments as defined in paragraph 80 or impairment associated with them. Financial assets under strict LOCOM with market risk induced value adjustments as defined in paragraph 80 shall not be considered as impaired. Accumulated credit-risk induced and market-risk induced value adjustments shall be reported separately.EN L 97/ . 82. Under national GAAP based on BAD, the amount of general allowances for banking risk to be reported in the applicable templates shall only be the part that affects the carrying amount of debt instruments (BAD Article ).EN  . 7.

FINANCIAL ASSETS SUBJECT TO IMPAIRMENT THAT ARE PAST DUE (7) 94. The carrying amount of debt instruments that are included in the accounting portfolios subject to impairment shall be reported in template only where they are past due. Past-due instruments shall be allocated to the corresponding past-due buckets on the basis of their individual situation. 95. Accounting portfolios subject to impairment shall be financial assets subject to impairment, as defined as in paragraph 93 of this Part. 96. Financial assets shall qualify as past due where any amount of principal, interest or fee has not been paid at the date it was due. Past due exposures shall be reported for their entire carrying amount and broken down according to the number of days of the oldest past due amount unpaid at the reference date. Under IFRS, the carrying amounts of assets that are not purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets shall be reported by impairment stages; the carrying amount of purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets shall be separately reported. Under national GAAP based on BAD, past-due assets shall be reported by impairment status in accordance with the applicable accounting standards.EN.   4.

BREAKDOWN OF FINANCIAL ASSETS BY INSTRUMENT AND BY COUNTERPARTY SECTOR (4) 67. Financial assets shall be broken down by accounting portfolio and instrument and – where required – by counterparty. For debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income and at amortised cost, the gross carrying amount of assets and accumulated impairments shall be broken down by impairment stages, except where they are purchased or originated financial assets that are credit-impaired at initial recognition as defined in IFRS 9 Appendix A. For these assets, the gross carrying amount and accumulated impairment shall be separately reported, outside the impairment stages, in templates and. 68. Derivatives reported as trading financial assets under GAAP based on BAD include instruments measured at fair value as well as instruments measured at cost-based methods or LOCOM.EN L 97/ . 69. For the purposes of Annexes III and IV as well as this Annex, ‘accumulated negative changes in fair value due to credit risk’ means, for non-performing exposures, accumulated changes in fair value due to credit risk where the accumulated net change is negative. The accumulated net change in fair value due to credit risk shall be calculated by adding all negative and positive changes in fair value due to credit risk that have occurred since recognition of the debt instrument. That amount shall only be reported where the addition of positive and negative changes in fair value due to credit risk results in a negative amount. The valuation of the debt instruments shall be performed on the level of single financial instruments. For each debt instrument, ‘Accumulated negative changes in fair value due to credit risk’ shall be reported until the derecognition of the instrument. 70. For the purposes of Annexes III and IV as well as this Annex, ‘accumulated impairment’ shall have the following meaning: (a) for debt instruments measured at amortised cost or at a cost-based method, that are not purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets, accumulated impairment is the cumulative amount of impairment losses, net of use and reversals that has been recognised, where appropriate for each of the impairment stages. Accumulated impairment reduces the carrying amount of the debt instrument through the use of an allowance account under IFRS and national GAAP based on BAD, or via direct reductions that do not constitute a derecognition event under national GAAP based on BAD; (b) for debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income under IFRS that are not purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets, accumulated impairment is the sum of expected credit losses and their variations recognised as a reduction of fair value on a given instrument since initial recognition; (c) for debt instruments at fair value through equity under national GAAP based on BAD subject to impairment, accumulated impairment is the cumulative amount of impairment losses, net of use and reversals that has been recognised. The reduction in the carrying amount is either made through use of an allowance account or via direct reductions that do not constitute a derecognition event. (d) for purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets, the initial estimate of lifetime expected credit losses is incorporated into the calculation of the credit-adjusted effective interest rate and accumulated impairment is the sum of subsequent changes in lifetime expected credit losses since initial recognition that are recognized as a variation of carrying amount/fair value on a given instrument. Accumulated impairment for purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets can be positive in case of impairment gains exceeding any previously recognised impairment losses (IFRS ). 71. Under IFRS, accumulated impairment shall include the allowance for expected credit losses for financial assets under each of the impairment stages specified by IFRS 9 and the allowance for purchased or originated credit- impaired financial assets. Under national GAAP based on BAD, it shall include specific and general allowance for credit risk, as well as the general allowance for banking risk where it reduces the carrying amount of debt instruments. Accumulated impairment shall also include the credit risk-induced value adjustments on financial assets under LOCOM. 72. ‘Accumulated partial write-offs’ and ‘Accumulated total write-offs’ shall include, respectively, the accumulated partial and total amount as at the reference date of principal and accrued past due interest and fees of any debt instrument that has been de-recognised to date using either of the methods described in paragraph 74 because the institution has no reasonable expectations of recovering the contractual cash flows. Those amounts shall be reported until the total extinguishment of all the reporting institution’s rights by expiry of the statute-of-limitations period, forgiveness or other causes, or until recovery. Therefore, where the written-off amounts are not recovered, they shall be reported while they are subject to enforcement activities.EN.  L 97/ 73. Where a debt instrument is eventually totally written-off because of successive partial write-offs, the cumu lative amount written-off shall be reclassified from the ‘Accumulated partial write-offs’ into the ‘Accumulated total write-offs’ column. 74. Write-offs shall constitute a derecognition event and relate to a financial asset in its entirety or to a portion of it, including where the modification of an asset leads the institution to give up its right of collecting cash flows on a portion or the entirety of this asset as further explained in paragraph 72. Write-offs shall include amounts caused by both reductions of the carrying amount of financial assets recognised directly in profit or loss and reductions in the amounts of the allowance accounts for credit losses taken against the carrying amount of financial assets. 75. The column ‘of which: Instruments with low credit risk’ shall include instruments that are determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date and for which the institution assumes that the credit risk has not increased significantly since initial recognition in accordance with IFRS. 76. Trade receivables within the meaning of IAS (h), contract assets and lease receivables for which the simplified approach of IFRS for the estimation of loss allowances has been applied, shall be reported within loans and advances in template. The corresponding loss allowance for those assets that are not purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets shall be reported in either ‘Accumulated impairment on assets with significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition but not credit-impaired (Stage 2)’ or ‘Accumulated impairment on credit-impaired assets (Stage 3)’, depending on whether trade receivables, contract assets or lease receivables under the simplified approach are considered as credit-impaired assets. 78. In template , institutions shall report the carrying amount of ‘Loans and advances’ and ‘Debt securities’ that fall within the definition of ‘subordinated debt’ in paragraph 100 of this Part. 79. In template , information to be reported depends on whether Non-trading non-derivative financial assets measured at fair value to equity can be subject to impairment requirements in application of the national GAAP based on BAD. Where those financial assets are subject to impairment, institutions shall report information in this template that relates to the carrying amount, the gross carrying amount of unimpaired assets and impaired assets, accumulated impairment and accumulated write-offs. Where those financial assets are not subject to impairment, institutions shall report the accumulated negative changes in fair value due to credit risk for non-performing exposures. 80. In template , financial assets measured under moderate LOCOM and their associated value adjustments shall be identified separately from other financial assets measured at a cost-based method and their associated impairment. Financial assets under a cost-based method, including financial assets under moderate LOCOM, shall be reported as unimpaired assets where they have no value adjustments or impairment associated with them, and as impaired assets in case they have value adjustments that qualify as impairment or impairment associated with them. Value adjustments that qualify as impairment shall be credit risk-induced value adjustments reflecting the deterioration of the creditworthiness of the counterparty. Financial assets under moderate LOCOM with market-risk induced value adjustments reflecting the impact of changes in the market conditions on the value of the asset shall not be considered as impaired. Accumulated credit-risk induced and market-risk induced value adjustments shall be reported separately. 81. In template , assets measured at strict LOCOM as well as their associated value adjustments shall be reported separately from assets under other measurement methods. Financial assets under strict LOCOM and financial assets under other measurement methods shall be reported as impaired assets in case they have credit-risk induced value adjustments as defined in paragraph 80 or impairment associated with them. Financial assets under strict LOCOM with market risk induced value adjustments as defined in paragraph 80 shall not be considered as impaired. Accumulated credit-risk induced and market-risk induced value adjustments shall be reported separately.EN L 97/ . 82. Under national GAAP based on BAD, the amount of general allowances for banking risk to be reported in the applicable templates shall only be the part that affects the carrying amount of debt instruments (BAD Article ).EN  . 7.

The carrying amount of debt instruments that are included in the accounting portfolios subject to impairment shall be reported in template only where they are past due. Past-due instruments shall be allocated to the corresponding past-due buckets on the basis of their individual situation. 95. Accounting portfolios subject to impairment shall be financial assets subject to impairment, as defined as in paragraph 93 of this Part. 96. Financial assets shall qualify as past due where any amount of principal, interest or fee has not been paid at the date it was due. Past due exposures shall be reported for their entire carrying amount and broken down according to the number of days of the oldest past due amount unpaid at the reference date. Under IFRS, the carrying amounts of assets that are not purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets shall be reported by impairment stages; the carrying amount of purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets shall be separately reported.

LOAN COMMITMENTS, FINANCIAL GUARANTEES AND OTHER COMMITMENTS (9) 102. Off-balance sheet exposures shall include the off-balance sheet items listed in Annex I to CRR. In templates , and , all off-balance sheet exposures listed in Annex I to CRR shall be broken down in loan commitments, financial guarantees, and other commitments. 103. Information on loan commitments, financial guarantees and other commitments given and received shall include both revocable and irrevocable commitments. 104. Loan commitments, financial guarantees and other commitments given listed in Annex I to CRR may be instruments that are in the scope of IFRS 9 where they are measured at fair value through profit or loss, or where they are subject to the impairment requirements of IFRS 9, as well as instruments that are within the scope of IAS 37 or IFRS 4. 105. Under IFRS, loan commitments, financial guarantees and other commitments given shall be reported in template where any of the following conditions are met: (a) they are subject to impairment requirements of IFRS 9; (b) they are designated at fair value through profit or loss under IFRS 9; (c) they are within the scope of IAS 37 or IFRS 4. 106. Liabilities that shall be recognised as credit losses for the financial guarantees and commitments given referred to under points (a) and (c) of paragraph 105 of this Part of this Annex shall be reported as provisions regardless of the measurement criteria applied. 107. Institutions under IFRS shall report the nominal amount and provisions of instruments that are subject to the impairment requirements of IFRS 9, including those measured at initial cost less cumulative income recog nised, broken down by impairment stages, except where they are deemed credit-impaired at initial recog nition consistently with the definition of purchased or originated financial assets of IFRS 9 Appendix A. For these exposures, the nominal amount and provisions shall be separately reported, outside the impairment stages in template. EN L 97/ . 108. Only the nominal amount of the commitment shall be reported in template where a debt instrument includes both an on-balance sheet instrument and an off-balance sheet component. Where the reporting entity is unable to identify separately the expected credit losses on the on-balance sheet and off-balance components, the expected credit losses on the commitment shall be reported together with the accumulated impairment on the on-balance sheet component. Where the combined expected credit losses exceed the gross carrying amount of the debt instrument, the remaining balance of the expected credit losses shall be reported as a provision in the appropriate column in template (IFRS and IFRS 7.B8E). 109. A financial guarantee or a commitment to provide a loan at a below-market rate that is measured in accordance with IFRS (d) and for which its loss allowance is determined in accordance with IFRS shall be reported in the appropriate column. 110. Where loan commitments, financial guarantees and other commitments are measured at fair value in accordance with IFRS 9, institutions shall report in template the nominal amount and accumulated negative changes in fair value due to credit risk of those financial guarantees and commitments in dedicated columns. ‘Accumulated negative changes in fair value due to credit risk’ shall be reported applying the criteria of paragraph 69of this Part. 111. The nominal amount and provisions of other commitments or guarantees that are within the scope of IAS 37 or IFRS 4 shall be reported in dedicated columns. 112. Institutions under national GAAP based on BAD shall report in template the nominal amount of commitments and financial guarantees referred to in paragraphs 102 and 103, as well as the amount of provisions required to be held against those off-balance sheet exposures. 113. ‘Loan commitments’ shall be firm commitments to provide credit under pre-specified terms and conditions, except those that are derivatives because they can be settled net in cash or by delivering or issuing another financial instrument. The following items of Annex I to CRR shall be classified as ‘Loan commitments’: (a) ‘Forward deposits’; (b) ‘Undrawn credit facilities’, which comprise agreements to ‘lend’ or provide ‘acceptance facilities’ under pre- specified terms and conditions. 114. ‘Financial guarantees’ shall be contracts that require the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the holder of a loss it incurs, because a specified debtor fails to make payment where due in accordance with the original or modified terms of a debt instrument, including guarantees provided for other financial guarantees. Under IFRS, those contracts shall meet the definition of financial guarantee contracts in IFRS (e) and IFRS 4.A. The following items of Annex I to CRR shall be classified as ‘financial guarantees’: (a) ‘Guarantees having the character of credit substitute’; (b) ‘Credit derivatives’ that meet the definition of financial guarantee; (c) ‘Irrevocable standby letters of credit having the character of credit substitutes’.EN.  L 97/ 115. ‘Other commitments’ shall include the following items of Annex I to CRR: (a) ‘Unpaid portion of partly-paid shares and securities’; (b) ‘Documentary credits issued or confirmed’; (c) ‘Trade finance off-balance sheet items’; (d) ‘Documentary credits in which underlying shipment acts as collateral and other self-liquidating trans actions’; (e) ‘Warranties and indemnities’ (including tender and performance bonds) and ‘guarantees not having the character of credit substitutes’; (f) ‘Shipping guarantees, customs and tax bonds’; (g) ‘Note issuance facilities’ (NIFs) and ‘Revolving underwritings facilities’ (RUFs); (h) ‘Undrawn credit facilities’ which comprise agreements to ‘lend’ or provide ‘acceptance facilities’ where the terms and conditions are not pre-specified; (i) ‘Undrawn credit facilities’ which comprise agreements to ‘purchase securities’ or ‘provide guarantees’; (j) ‘Undrawn credit facilities for tender and performance guarantees’; (k) ‘Other off-balance sheet items’ in Annex I to CRR. 116. Under IFRS, the following items are recognised in the balance sheet and, consequently, shall not be reported as off-balance sheet exposures: (a) ‘Credit derivatives’ that do not meet the definition of financial guarantees are ‘derivatives’ under IFRS 9; (b) ‘Acceptances’ are obligations by an institution to pay on maturity the face value of a bill of exchange, normally covering the sale of goods. Consequently, they are classified as ‘trade receivables’ on the balance sheet; (c) ‘Endorsements on bills’ that do not meet the criteria for derecognition under IFRS 9; (d) ‘Transactions with recourse’ that do not meet the criteria for derecognition under IFRS 9; (e) ‘Assets purchased under outright forward purchase agreements’ are ‘derivatives’ under IFRS 9; (f) ‘Asset sale and repurchase agreements as referred to in paragraphs 3 and 5 of Article 12 of Directive 86/635/EEC’. In those contracts, the transferee has the option, but not the obligation, to return the assets at a price agreed in advance on a date specified or on a date to be specified. Therefore, those contracts meet the definition of derivatives in Appendix A to IFRS 9. 117. The item ‘of which: non-performing’ shall include the nominal amount of those loan commitments, financial guarantees and other commitments given that are considered as non-performing in accordance with para graphs 213 to 239 of this Part. 118. For financial guarantees, loan commitments and other commitments given, the ‘Nominal amount’ shall be the amount that best represents the institution’s maximum exposure to credit risk without taking account of any collateral held or other credit enhancements. In particular, for financial guarantees given, the nominal amount shall be the maximum amount the entity would have to pay if the guarantee is called on. For loan commitments, the nominal amount shall be the undrawn amount that the institution has committed to lend. Nominal amounts shall be the exposure values before applying conversion factors and credit risk mitigation techniques.EN L 97/ . 119. In template , for loan commitments received, the nominal amount shall be the total undrawn amount that the counterparty has committed to lend to the institution. For other commitments received, the nominal amount shall be the total amount committed by the other party in the transaction. For financial guarantees received, the ‘maximum amount of the guarantee that can be considered’ shall be the maximum amount the counterparty would have to pay if the guarantee is called on. Where a financial guarantee received has been issued by more than one guarantor, the guaranteed amount shall be reported only once in this template; the guaranteed amount shall be allocated to guarantor that is more relevant for the mitigation of credit risk.EN.   10.

DERIVATIVES AND HEDGE ACCOUNTING (10 AND 11) 120. For the purpose of templates 10 and 11, derivatives shall be considered either as hedging derivatives where they are used in a qualifying hedging relationship in accordance with IFRS or with the applicable national GAAP under BAD, or as held for trading in other cases. 121. The carrying amount and the notional amount of the derivatives held for trading, including economic hedges, as well as the derivatives held for hedge accounting shall be reported broken down by type of underlying risk, type of market and type of product in templates 10 and 11. Institutions shall report the derivatives held for hedge accounting also broken down by type of hedge. Information on non-derivative hedging instruments shall be reported separately and broken down by types of hedges. 122. Under the relevant national GAAP based on BAD, all derivatives shall be reported in these templates irrespective of whether they are or are not recognised on the balance sheet under the relevant national GAAP. 123. The breakdown of the carrying amount, fair value and notional amount of trading and hedging derivatives by accounting portfolios and types of hedges shall be implemented taking into consideration the accounting portfolios and types of hedges that are applicable in IFRS or national GAAP under BAD, whichever framework applies to the reporting entity. 124. Trading derivatives and hedging derivatives which, in accordance with national GAAP based on BAD, are measured at cost or LOCOM shall be identified separately. 125. Template 11 shall include hedging instruments and hedged items irrespective of the accounting standard used to recognise a qualifying hedge relationship, including where that qualifying hedge relationship concerns a net position. Where an institution has elected to keep applying IAS 39 for hedge accounting (IFRS ), the references and names for the types of hedges and accounting portfolios shall be read as the relevant references and names in IAS : ‘Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income’ shall refer to ‘Available for sale assets’, and ‘Assets at amortised cost shall gather ‘Held to maturity’ as well as ‘Loans and receivables’. 126. Derivatives included in hybrid instruments, which have been separated from the host contract, shall be reported in templates 10 and 11 according to the nature of the derivative. The amount of the host contract is not included in those templates. However, where the hybrid instrument is measured at fair value through profit or loss, the contract shall be reported as a whole and the embedded derivatives shall not be reported in templates 10 and 11. 127. Commitments considered as derivatives (IFRS (b)) and credit derivatives that do not meet the definition of a financial guarantee in paragraph 114 of this Part of this Annex shall be reported in template 10 and template 11 following the same breakdowns as the other derivative instruments, but not be reported in template 9. 128. The carrying amount of non-derivative financial assets or non-derivative financial liabilities that are recognised as hedging instrument in application of IFRS or the relevant national GAAP under BAD shall be reported separately in template. EN.  L 97/. Classification of derivatives by type of risk 129. All derivatives shall be classified into one of the following risk categories: (a) interest rate: Interest rate derivatives shall be contracts related to an interest-bearing financial instrument the cash flows of which are determined by referencing interest rates or another interest rate contract such as an option on a futures contract to purchase a treasury bill. That category shall be restricted to those deals where all the legs are exposed to only one currency’s interest rate. It shall thus exclude contracts involving the exchange of one or more foreign currencies such as cross-currency swaps and currency options, and other contracts the predominant risk characteristic of which is foreign exchange risk, which are to be reported as foreign exchange contracts. The only exception is where cross-currency swaps are used as part of a portfolio hedge of interest rate risk, where they shall be reported in the dedicated rows for those types of hedges. Interest rate contracts shall include forward rate agreements, single-currency interest rate swaps, interest rate futures, interest rate options (including caps, floors, collars and corridors), interest rate swaps and interest rate warrants; (b) equity: Equity derivatives shall be contracts that have a return, or a portion of their return, linked to the price of a particular equity or to an index of equity prices; (c) foreign exchange and gold: These derivatives shall include contracts involving the exchange of currencies in the forward market and the exposure to gold. They shall therefore cover outright forwards, foreign exchange swaps, currency swaps (including cross-currency interest rate swaps), currency futures, currency options, currency swaps and currency warrants. Foreign exchange derivatives shall include all deals involving exposure to more than one currency, whether in exchange rates or in interest rates, except where cross-currency swaps are used as part of a portfolio hedge of interest rate risk. Gold contracts shall include all deals involving exposure to that commodity; (d) credit: Credit derivatives shall be contracts in which the payout is linked primarily to some measure of the creditworthiness of a particular reference credit and that do not meet the definition of financial guarantees (IFRS (c)). The contracts shall specify an exchange of payments in which at least one of the two legs is determined by the performance of the reference credit. Payouts can be triggered by a number of events, including a default, a rating downgrade or a stipulated change in the credit spread of the reference asset. Credit derivatives that meet the definition of a financial guarantee in paragraph 114 of this Part of this Annex shall be reported only in template 9; (e) commodity: These derivatives shall be contracts that have a return, or a portion of their return, linked to the price of, or to a price index of, a commodity such as a precious metal (other than gold), petroleum, lumber or agricultural products; (f) other: those derivatives shall be any other derivative contracts, which do not involve an exposure to foreign exchange, interest rate, equity, commodity or credit risk such as climatic derivatives or insurance derivatives. 130. Where a derivative is influenced by more than one type of underlying risk, the instrument shall be allocated to the most sensitive type of risk. For multi-exposure derivatives, in cases of uncertainty, the deals shall be allocated according to the following order of precedence: (a) commodities: All derivatives transactions involving a commodity or commodity index exposure, whether or not they involve a joint exposure in commodities and any other risk category which may include foreign exchange, interest rate or equity, shall be reported in this category;EN L 97/ . (b) equities: With the exception of contracts with a joint exposure to commodities and equities, which are to be reported as commodities, all derivatives transactions with a link to the performance of equities or equity indices shall be reported in the equity category. Equity deals with exposure to foreign exchange or interest rates shall be included in this category; (c) foreign exchange and gold: This category shall include all derivatives transactions (with the exception of those already reported in the commodity or equity categories) with exposure to more than one currency, be it pertaining to either interest-bearing financial instruments or exchange rates, except where cross- currency swaps are used as part of a portfolio hedge of interest rate risk.. Amounts to be reported for derivatives 131. Under IFRS, the ‘carrying amount’ for all derivatives (hedging or trading) shall be the fair value. Derivatives with a positive fair value (above zero) shall be ‘financial assets’ and derivatives with a negative fair value (below zero) shall be ‘financial liabilities’. The ‘carrying amount’ shall be reported separately for derivatives with a positive fair value (‘financial assets’) and for those with a negative fair value (‘financial liabilities’). At the date of initial recognition, a derivative shall be classified as ‘financial asset’ or ‘financial liability’ according to its initial fair value. After initial recognition, as the fair value of a derivative increases or decreases, the terms of the exchange may become either favourable to the institution (and the derivative is classified as ‘financial asset’) or unfavourable (and the derivative is classified as ‘financial liability’). The carrying amount of hedging derivatives shall be their entire fair value, including, where applicable, the components of this fair value that are not designated as hedging instruments. 132. In addition to carrying amounts as defined in paragraph 27 of Part 1 of this Annex, fair values shall be reported by reporting institutions under national GAAP based on BAD for all derivative instruments, whether required to be booked on-balance sheet or off-balance sheet by the national GAAP based on BAD. 133. The ‘Notional amount’ shall be the gross nominal of all deals concluded and not yet settled at the reference date, regardless of whether those deals lead to derivative exposures being booked on-balance sheet. In particular, the following shall be taken into account to determine the notional amount: (a) for contracts with variable nominal or notional principal amounts, the basis for reporting shall be the nominal or notional principal amounts at the reference date; (b) the notional amount value to be reported for a derivative contract with a multiplier component shall be the contract effective notional amount or par value; (c) swaps: The notional amount of a swap shall be the underlying principal amount upon which the exchange of interest, foreign exchange or other income or expense is based; (d) equity and commodity-linked contracts: The notional amount to be reported for an equity or commodity contract shall be the quantity of the commodity or equity product contracted for purchase or sale multiplied by the contract price of a unit. The notional amount to be reported for commodity contracts with multiple exchanges of principal shall be the contractual amount multiplied by the number of remaining exchanges of principal in the contract; (e) credit derivatives: The contract amount to be reported for credit derivatives shall be the nominal value of the relevant reference credit; (f) digital options have a predefined payoff, which can be either a monetary amount or a number of contracts of an underlying. The notional amount for digital options shall be either the predefined monetary amount or the fair value of the underlying at the reference date.EN.  L 97/ 134. The column ‘Notional amount’ of derivatives shall include, for each line item, the sum of the notional amounts of all contracts in which the institution is counterparty, irrespective of whether the derivatives are considered assets or liabilities on the face of the balance sheet or are not booked on-balance sheet. All notional amounts shall be reported, regardless of whether the fair value of derivatives is positive, negative or equal to zero. Netting among the notional amounts shall not be allowed. 135. The ‘Notional amount’ shall be reported by ‘total’ and by ‘of which: sold’ for the line items: ‘OTC options’, ‘Organised market options’, ‘Credit’, ‘Commodity’ and ‘Other’. The item ‘of which sold’ shall include the notional amounts (strike price) of the contracts in which the counterparties (option holders) of the institution (option writer) have the right to exercise the option, and for the items related to credit risk derivatives, the notional amounts of the contracts in which the institution (protection seller) has sold (gives) protection to its counterparties (protection buyers). 136. The allocation of a transaction as ‘OTC’ or ‘Organized market’ shall be based on the nature of the market where the transaction takes place and not on whether there is a mandatory clearing obligation for that transaction. An ‘Organised market’ is a regulated market in the meaning of point (92) of Article 4(1) CRR. Therefore, where a reporting entity enters into a derivative contract in an OTC market where central clearing is compulsory, it shall classify that derivative as ‘OTC’ and not as ‘Organised market’.. Derivatives classified as ‘economic hedges’ 137. Derivatives that are held for hedging purposes but which do not meet the criteria to be effective hedging instruments in accordance with IFRS 9, with IAS 39 where IAS 39 is applied for hedge accounting purposes or with the accounting framework under national GAAP based on BAD, shall be reported in template 10 as ‘economic hedges’. This shall apply also to all of the following cases: (a) derivatives hedging unquoted equity instruments for which cost may be an appropriate estimate of fair value; (b) credit derivatives measured at fair value through profit or loss used to manage the credit risk of all, or part of, a financial instrument that is designated as measured at fair value through profit or loss at, or subsequent to, initial recognition, or while it is unrecognised in accordance with IFRS. ; (c) derivatives that are classified as ‘held for trading’ in accordance with Appendix A to IFRS 9 or classified as trading assets in accordance with the national GAAP based on BAD but are not part of the trading book as defined in point (86) of Article 4(1) CRR. 138. ‘Economic hedges’ shall not include derivatives for proprietary trading. 139. Derivatives that meet the definition of ‘economic hedges’ shall be reported separately in template 10 for each type of risk. 140. Credit derivatives used to manage the credit risk of all, or part of, a financial instrument that is designated as measured at fair value through profit or loss at, or subsequent to, initial recognition, or while it is unre cognised in accordance with IFRS , shall be reported in a dedicated row in template 10 within credit risk. Other economic hedges of credit risk for which the reporting entity does not apply IFRS shall be reported separately.EN L 97/ ..  Breakdown of derivatives by counterparty sector 141. The carrying amount and the total notional amount of derivatives held for trading, and also of derivatives held for hedge accounting, which are traded in the OTC market, shall be reported by counterparties using the following categories: (a) ‘credit institutions’; (b) ‘other financial corporations’; (c) ‘rest’ comprising all other counterparties. 142. All OTC derivatives, irrespective of the type of risk to which they are related, shall be broken down by those counterparties.. Hedge accounting under national GAAP () 143. Where national GAAP under BAD require the allocation of hedging derivatives across categories of hedges, the hedging derivatives shall be separately reported for each of the applicable categories: ‘fair-value hedges’, ‘cash flow hedges’, ‘cost-price hedges’, ‘hedge in net investments in a foreign operation’, ‘portfolio fair value hedges of interest rate risk’ and ‘portfolio cash flow hedges of interest rate risk’. 144. Where applicable in accordance with national GAAP based on BAD, ‘Cost price hedges’ shall refer to a hedging category in which the hedging derivative is generally measured at cost.. Amount to be reported for non-derivative hedging instruments ( and ) 145. For non-derivative hedging instruments, the amount to be reported shall be the carrying amount of those non-derivative hedging instruments according to the applicable measurement rules in IFRS or in GAAP based on BAD for the accounting portfolios to which they belong. No ‘notional amount’ shall be reported for non- derivative hedging instruments.. Hedged items in fair value hedges () 146. The carrying amount of hedged items in a fair value hedge recognised on the statement of financial position shall be broken down by accounting portfolio and type of hedged risk for hedged financial assets and hedged financial liabilities. Where a financial instrument is hedged for more than one risk, it shall be reported in the type of risk in which the hedging instrument shall be reported in accordance with paragraph 129. 147. ‘Micro-hedges’ shall be hedges other than portfolio hedge of interest rate risk in accordance with IAS A. Micro-hedges shall include hedges of nil net positions as referred to in accordance with IFRS. 148. ‘Hedge adjustments on micro-hedges’ shall include all hedge adjustments for all the micro-hedges as defined in paragraph 147.EN.  L 97/ 149. ‘Hedge adjustments included in the carrying amount of assets/liabilities’ shall be the accumulated amount of the gains and losses on the hedged items that have adjusted the carrying amount of those items and been recognised in profit or loss. Hedge adjustments for the hedged items that are equities measured at fair value through other comprehensive income shall be reported in template. Hedge adjustments for unrecognised firm commitments or a component thereof shall not be reported. 150. ‘Remaining adjustments for discontinued micro-hedges including hedges of net positions’ shall include those hedge adjustments which, following the discontinuation of the hedge relationship and the end of the adjustment of hedged items for hedging gains and losses, remain to be amortised to the profit or loss via a recalculated effective interest rate for hedged items measured at amortised cost, or to the amount that represents the previously recognised cumulative hedging gain or loss for hedged assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. 151. Where a group of financial assets or financial liabilities, including a group of financial assets or financial liabilities that constitute a net position, is eligible as a hedged item, financial assets and financial liabilities constituting that group shall be reported at their carrying amount on a gross basis, before netting between instruments within the group, in ‘Assets or liabilities included in hedge of a net position (before netting)’. 152. ‘Hedged items in portfolio hedge of interest rate risk’ shall include financial assets and financial liabilities included in a fair value hedge of the interest rate exposure of a portfolio of financial assets or financial liabilities. Those financial instruments shall be reported at their carrying amount on a gross basis, before netting between instruments within the portfolio.EN  . 11.

DERIVATIVES AND HEDGE ACCOUNTING (10 AND 11) 120. For the purpose of templates 10 and 11, derivatives shall be considered either as hedging derivatives where they are used in a qualifying hedging relationship in accordance with IFRS or with the applicable national GAAP under BAD, or as held for trading in other cases. 121. The carrying amount and the notional amount of the derivatives held for trading, including economic hedges, as well as the derivatives held for hedge accounting shall be reported broken down by type of underlying risk, type of market and type of product in templates 10 and 11. Institutions shall report the derivatives held for hedge accounting also broken down by type of hedge. Information on non-derivative hedging instruments shall be reported separately and broken down by types of hedges. 122. Under the relevant national GAAP based on BAD, all derivatives shall be reported in these templates irrespective of whether they are or are not recognised on the balance sheet under the relevant national GAAP. 123. The breakdown of the carrying amount, fair value and notional amount of trading and hedging derivatives by accounting portfolios and types of hedges shall be implemented taking into consideration the accounting portfolios and types of hedges that are applicable in IFRS or national GAAP under BAD, whichever framework applies to the reporting entity. 124. Trading derivatives and hedging derivatives which, in accordance with national GAAP based on BAD, are measured at cost or LOCOM shall be identified separately. 125. Template 11 shall include hedging instruments and hedged items irrespective of the accounting standard used to recognise a qualifying hedge relationship, including where that qualifying hedge relationship concerns a net position. Where an institution has elected to keep applying IAS 39 for hedge accounting (IFRS ), the references and names for the types of hedges and accounting portfolios shall be read as the relevant references and names in IAS : ‘Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income’ shall refer to ‘Available for sale assets’, and ‘Assets at amortised cost shall gather ‘Held to maturity’ as well as ‘Loans and receivables’. 126. Derivatives included in hybrid instruments, which have been separated from the host contract, shall be reported in templates 10 and 11 according to the nature of the derivative. The amount of the host contract is not included in those templates. However, where the hybrid instrument is measured at fair value through profit or loss, the contract shall be reported as a whole and the embedded derivatives shall not be reported in templates 10 and 11. 127. Commitments considered as derivatives (IFRS (b)) and credit derivatives that do not meet the definition of a financial guarantee in paragraph 114 of this Part of this Annex shall be reported in template 10 and template 11 following the same breakdowns as the other derivative instruments, but not be reported in template 9. 128. The carrying amount of non-derivative financial assets or non-derivative financial liabilities that are recognised as hedging instrument in application of IFRS or the relevant national GAAP under BAD shall be reported separately in template. EN.  L 97/. Classification of derivatives by type of risk 129. All derivatives shall be classified into one of the following risk categories: (a) interest rate: Interest rate derivatives shall be contracts related to an interest-bearing financial instrument the cash flows of which are determined by referencing interest rates or another interest rate contract such as an option on a futures contract to purchase a treasury bill. That category shall be restricted to those deals where all the legs are exposed to only one currency’s interest rate. It shall thus exclude contracts involving the exchange of one or more foreign currencies such as cross-currency swaps and currency options, and other contracts the predominant risk characteristic of which is foreign exchange risk, which are to be reported as foreign exchange contracts. The only exception is where cross-currency swaps are used as part of a portfolio hedge of interest rate risk, where they shall be reported in the dedicated rows for those types of hedges. Interest rate contracts shall include forward rate agreements, single-currency interest rate swaps, interest rate futures, interest rate options (including caps, floors, collars and corridors), interest rate swaps and interest rate warrants; (b) equity: Equity derivatives shall be contracts that have a return, or a portion of their return, linked to the price of a particular equity or to an index of equity prices; (c) foreign exchange and gold: These derivatives shall include contracts involving the exchange of currencies in the forward market and the exposure to gold. They shall therefore cover outright forwards, foreign exchange swaps, currency swaps (including cross-currency interest rate swaps), currency futures, currency options, currency swaps and currency warrants. Foreign exchange derivatives shall include all deals involving exposure to more than one currency, whether in exchange rates or in interest rates, except where cross-currency swaps are used as part of a portfolio hedge of interest rate risk. Gold contracts shall include all deals involving exposure to that commodity; (d) credit: Credit derivatives shall be contracts in which the payout is linked primarily to some measure of the creditworthiness of a particular reference credit and that do not meet the definition of financial guarantees (IFRS (c)). The contracts shall specify an exchange of payments in which at least one of the two legs is determined by the performance of the reference credit. Payouts can be triggered by a number of events, including a default, a rating downgrade or a stipulated change in the credit spread of the reference asset. Credit derivatives that meet the definition of a financial guarantee in paragraph 114 of this Part of this Annex shall be reported only in template 9; (e) commodity: These derivatives shall be contracts that have a return, or a portion of their return, linked to the price of, or to a price index of, a commodity such as a precious metal (other than gold), petroleum, lumber or agricultural products; (f) other: those derivatives shall be any other derivative contracts, which do not involve an exposure to foreign exchange, interest rate, equity, commodity or credit risk such as climatic derivatives or insurance derivatives. 130. Where a derivative is influenced by more than one type of underlying risk, the instrument shall be allocated to the most sensitive type of risk. For multi-exposure derivatives, in cases of uncertainty, the deals shall be allocated according to the following order of precedence: (a) commodities: All derivatives transactions involving a commodity or commodity index exposure, whether or not they involve a joint exposure in commodities and any other risk category which may include foreign exchange, interest rate or equity, shall be reported in this category;EN L 97/ . (b) equities: With the exception of contracts with a joint exposure to commodities and equities, which are to be reported as commodities, all derivatives transactions with a link to the performance of equities or equity indices shall be reported in the equity category. Equity deals with exposure to foreign exchange or interest rates shall be included in this category; (c) foreign exchange and gold: This category shall include all derivatives transactions (with the exception of those already reported in the commodity or equity categories) with exposure to more than one currency, be it pertaining to either interest-bearing financial instruments or exchange rates, except where cross- currency swaps are used as part of a portfolio hedge of interest rate risk.. Amounts to be reported for derivatives 131. Under IFRS, the ‘carrying amount’ for all derivatives (hedging or trading) shall be the fair value. Derivatives with a positive fair value (above zero) shall be ‘financial assets’ and derivatives with a negative fair value (below zero) shall be ‘financial liabilities’. The ‘carrying amount’ shall be reported separately for derivatives with a positive fair value (‘financial assets’) and for those with a negative fair value (‘financial liabilities’). At the date of initial recognition, a derivative shall be classified as ‘financial asset’ or ‘financial liability’ according to its initial fair value. After initial recognition, as the fair value of a derivative increases or decreases, the terms of the exchange may become either favourable to the institution (and the derivative is classified as ‘financial asset’) or unfavourable (and the derivative is classified as ‘financial liability’). The carrying amount of hedging derivatives shall be their entire fair value, including, where applicable, the components of this fair value that are not designated as hedging instruments. 132. In addition to carrying amounts as defined in paragraph 27 of Part 1 of this Annex, fair values shall be reported by reporting institutions under national GAAP based on BAD for all derivative instruments, whether required to be booked on-balance sheet or off-balance sheet by the national GAAP based on BAD. 133. The ‘Notional amount’ shall be the gross nominal of all deals concluded and not yet settled at the reference date, regardless of whether those deals lead to derivative exposures being booked on-balance sheet. In particular, the following shall be taken into account to determine the notional amount: (a) for contracts with variable nominal or notional principal amounts, the basis for reporting shall be the nominal or notional principal amounts at the reference date; (b) the notional amount value to be reported for a derivative contract with a multiplier component shall be the contract effective notional amount or par value; (c) swaps: The notional amount of a swap shall be the underlying principal amount upon which the exchange of interest, foreign exchange or other income or expense is based; (d) equity and commodity-linked contracts: The notional amount to be reported for an equity or commodity contract shall be the quantity of the commodity or equity product contracted for purchase or sale multiplied by the contract price of a unit. The notional amount to be reported for commodity contracts with multiple exchanges of principal shall be the contractual amount multiplied by the number of remaining exchanges of principal in the contract; (e) credit derivatives: The contract amount to be reported for credit derivatives shall be the nominal value of the relevant reference credit; (f) digital options have a predefined payoff, which can be either a monetary amount or a number of contracts of an underlying. The notional amount for digital options shall be either the predefined monetary amount or the fair value of the underlying at the reference date.EN.  L 97/ 134. The column ‘Notional amount’ of derivatives shall include, for each line item, the sum of the notional amounts of all contracts in which the institution is counterparty, irrespective of whether the derivatives are considered assets or liabilities on the face of the balance sheet or are not booked on-balance sheet. All notional amounts shall be reported, regardless of whether the fair value of derivatives is positive, negative or equal to zero. Netting among the notional amounts shall not be allowed. 135. The ‘Notional amount’ shall be reported by ‘total’ and by ‘of which: sold’ for the line items: ‘OTC options’, ‘Organised market options’, ‘Credit’, ‘Commodity’ and ‘Other’. The item ‘of which sold’ shall include the notional amounts (strike price) of the contracts in which the counterparties (option holders) of the institution (option writer) have the right to exercise the option, and for the items related to credit risk derivatives, the notional amounts of the contracts in which the institution (protection seller) has sold (gives) protection to its counterparties (protection buyers). 136. The allocation of a transaction as ‘OTC’ or ‘Organized market’ shall be based on the nature of the market where the transaction takes place and not on whether there is a mandatory clearing obligation for that transaction. An ‘Organised market’ is a regulated market in the meaning of point (92) of Article 4(1) CRR. Therefore, where a reporting entity enters into a derivative contract in an OTC market where central clearing is compulsory, it shall classify that derivative as ‘OTC’ and not as ‘Organised market’.. Derivatives classified as ‘economic hedges’ 137. Derivatives that are held for hedging purposes but which do not meet the criteria to be effective hedging instruments in accordance with IFRS 9, with IAS 39 where IAS 39 is applied for hedge accounting purposes or with the accounting framework under national GAAP based on BAD, shall be reported in template 10 as ‘economic hedges’. This shall apply also to all of the following cases: (a) derivatives hedging unquoted equity instruments for which cost may be an appropriate estimate of fair value; (b) credit derivatives measured at fair value through profit or loss used to manage the credit risk of all, or part of, a financial instrument that is designated as measured at fair value through profit or loss at, or subsequent to, initial recognition, or while it is unrecognised in accordance with IFRS. ; (c) derivatives that are classified as ‘held for trading’ in accordance with Appendix A to IFRS 9 or classified as trading assets in accordance with the national GAAP based on BAD but are not part of the trading book as defined in point (86) of Article 4(1) CRR. 138. ‘Economic hedges’ shall not include derivatives for proprietary trading. 139. Derivatives that meet the definition of ‘economic hedges’ shall be reported separately in template 10 for each type of risk. 140. Credit derivatives used to manage the credit risk of all, or part of, a financial instrument that is designated as measured at fair value through profit or loss at, or subsequent to, initial recognition, or while it is unre cognised in accordance with IFRS , shall be reported in a dedicated row in template 10 within credit risk. Other economic hedges of credit risk for which the reporting entity does not apply IFRS shall be reported separately.EN L 97/ ..  Breakdown of derivatives by counterparty sector 141. The carrying amount and the total notional amount of derivatives held for trading, and also of derivatives held for hedge accounting, which are traded in the OTC market, shall be reported by counterparties using the following categories: (a) ‘credit institutions’; (b) ‘other financial corporations’; (c) ‘rest’ comprising all other counterparties. 142. All OTC derivatives, irrespective of the type of risk to which they are related, shall be broken down by those counterparties.. Hedge accounting under national GAAP () 143. Where national GAAP under BAD require the allocation of hedging derivatives across categories of hedges, the hedging derivatives shall be separately reported for each of the applicable categories: ‘fair-value hedges’, ‘cash flow hedges’, ‘cost-price hedges’, ‘hedge in net investments in a foreign operation’, ‘portfolio fair value hedges of interest rate risk’ and ‘portfolio cash flow hedges of interest rate risk’. 144. Where applicable in accordance with national GAAP based on BAD, ‘Cost price hedges’ shall refer to a hedging category in which the hedging derivative is generally measured at cost.. Amount to be reported for non-derivative hedging instruments ( and ) 145. For non-derivative hedging instruments, the amount to be reported shall be the carrying amount of those non-derivative hedging instruments according to the applicable measurement rules in IFRS or in GAAP based on BAD for the accounting portfolios to which they belong. No ‘notional amount’ shall be reported for non- derivative hedging instruments.. Hedged items in fair value hedges () 146. The carrying amount of hedged items in a fair value hedge recognised on the statement of financial position shall be broken down by accounting portfolio and type of hedged risk for hedged financial assets and hedged financial liabilities. Where a financial instrument is hedged for more than one risk, it shall be reported in the type of risk in which the hedging instrument shall be reported in accordance with paragraph 129. 147. ‘Micro-hedges’ shall be hedges other than portfolio hedge of interest rate risk in accordance with IAS A. Micro-hedges shall include hedges of nil net positions as referred to in accordance with IFRS. 148. ‘Hedge adjustments on micro-hedges’ shall include all hedge adjustments for all the micro-hedges as defined in paragraph 147.EN.  L 97/ 149. ‘Hedge adjustments included in the carrying amount of assets/liabilities’ shall be the accumulated amount of the gains and losses on the hedged items that have adjusted the carrying amount of those items and been recognised in profit or loss. Hedge adjustments for the hedged items that are equities measured at fair value through other comprehensive income shall be reported in template. Hedge adjustments for unrecognised firm commitments or a component thereof shall not be reported. 150. ‘Remaining adjustments for discontinued micro-hedges including hedges of net positions’ shall include those hedge adjustments which, following the discontinuation of the hedge relationship and the end of the adjustment of hedged items for hedging gains and losses, remain to be amortised to the profit or loss via a recalculated effective interest rate for hedged items measured at amortised cost, or to the amount that represents the previously recognised cumulative hedging gain or loss for hedged assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. 151. Where a group of financial assets or financial liabilities, including a group of financial assets or financial liabilities that constitute a net position, is eligible as a hedged item, financial assets and financial liabilities constituting that group shall be reported at their carrying amount on a gross basis, before netting between instruments within the group, in ‘Assets or liabilities included in hedge of a net position (before netting)’. 152. ‘Hedged items in portfolio hedge of interest rate risk’ shall include financial assets and financial liabilities included in a fair value hedge of the interest rate exposure of a portfolio of financial assets or financial liabilities. Those financial instruments shall be reported at their carrying amount on a gross basis, before netting between instruments within the portfolio.EN.   10.

DERIVATIVES AND HEDGE ACCOUNTING (10 AND 11) 120. For the purpose of templates 10 and 11, derivatives shall be considered either as hedging derivatives where they are used in a qualifying hedging relationship in accordance with IFRS or with the applicable national GAAP under BAD, or as held for trading in other cases. 121. The carrying amount and the notional amount of the derivatives held for trading, including economic hedges, as well as the derivatives held for hedge accounting shall be reported broken down by type of underlying risk, type of market and type of product in templates 10 and 11. Institutions shall report the derivatives held for hedge accounting also broken down by type of hedge. Information on non-derivative hedging instruments shall be reported separately and broken down by types of hedges. 122. Under the relevant national GAAP based on BAD, all derivatives shall be reported in these templates irrespective of whether they are or are not recognised on the balance sheet under the relevant national GAAP. 123. The breakdown of the carrying amount, fair value and notional amount of trading and hedging derivatives by accounting portfolios and types of hedges shall be implemented taking into consideration the accounting portfolios and types of hedges that are applicable in IFRS or national GAAP under BAD, whichever framework applies to the reporting entity. 124. Trading derivatives and hedging derivatives which, in accordance with national GAAP based on BAD, are measured at cost or LOCOM shall be identified separately. 125. Template 11 shall include hedging instruments and hedged items irrespective of the accounting standard used to recognise a qualifying hedge relationship, including where that qualifying hedge relationship concerns a net position. Where an institution has elected to keep applying IAS 39 for hedge accounting (IFRS ), the references and names for the types of hedges and accounting portfolios shall be read as the relevant references and names in IAS : ‘Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income’ shall refer to ‘Available for sale assets’, and ‘Assets at amortised cost shall gather ‘Held to maturity’ as well as ‘Loans and receivables’. 126. Derivatives included in hybrid instruments, which have been separated from the host contract, shall be reported in templates 10 and 11 according to the nature of the derivative. The amount of the host contract is not included in those templates. However, where the hybrid instrument is measured at fair value through profit or loss, the contract shall be reported as a whole and the embedded derivatives shall not be reported in templates 10 and 11. 127. Commitments considered as derivatives (IFRS (b)) and credit derivatives that do not meet the definition of a financial guarantee in paragraph 114 of this Part of this Annex shall be reported in template 10 and template 11 following the same breakdowns as the other derivative instruments, but not be reported in template 9. 128. The carrying amount of non-derivative financial assets or non-derivative financial liabilities that are recognised as hedging instrument in application of IFRS or the relevant national GAAP under BAD shall be reported separately in template. EN.  L 97/. Classification of derivatives by type of risk 129. All derivatives shall be classified into one of the following risk categories: (a) interest rate: Interest rate derivatives shall be contracts related to an interest-bearing financial instrument the cash flows of which are determined by referencing interest rates or another interest rate contract such as an option on a futures contract to purchase a treasury bill. That category shall be restricted to those deals where all the legs are exposed to only one currency’s interest rate. It shall thus exclude contracts involving the exchange of one or more foreign currencies such as cross-currency swaps and currency options, and other contracts the predominant risk characteristic of which is foreign exchange risk, which are to be reported as foreign exchange contracts. The only exception is where cross-currency swaps are used as part of a portfolio hedge of interest rate risk, where they shall be reported in the dedicated rows for those types of hedges. Interest rate contracts shall include forward rate agreements, single-currency interest rate swaps, interest rate futures, interest rate options (including caps, floors, collars and corridors), interest rate swaps and interest rate warrants; (b) equity: Equity derivatives shall be contracts that have a return, or a portion of their return, linked to the price of a particular equity or to an index of equity prices; (c) foreign exchange and gold: These derivatives shall include contracts involving the exchange of currencies in the forward market and the exposure to gold. They shall therefore cover outright forwards, foreign exchange swaps, currency swaps (including cross-currency interest rate swaps), currency futures, currency options, currency swaps and currency warrants. Foreign exchange derivatives shall include all deals involving exposure to more than one currency, whether in exchange rates or in interest rates, except where cross-currency swaps are used as part of a portfolio hedge of interest rate risk. Gold contracts shall include all deals involving exposure to that commodity; (d) credit: Credit derivatives shall be contracts in which the payout is linked primarily to some measure of the creditworthiness of a particular reference credit and that do not meet the definition of financial guarantees (IFRS (c)). The contracts shall specify an exchange of payments in which at least one of the two legs is determined by the performance of the reference credit. Payouts can be triggered by a number of events, including a default, a rating downgrade or a stipulated change in the credit spread of the reference asset. Credit derivatives that meet the definition of a financial guarantee in paragraph 114 of this Part of this Annex shall be reported only in template 9; (e) commodity: These derivatives shall be contracts that have a return, or a portion of their return, linked to the price of, or to a price index of, a commodity such as a precious metal (other than gold), petroleum, lumber or agricultural products; (f) other: those derivatives shall be any other derivative contracts, which do not involve an exposure to foreign exchange, interest rate, equity, commodity or credit risk such as climatic derivatives or insurance derivatives. 130. Where a derivative is influenced by more than one type of underlying risk, the instrument shall be allocated to the most sensitive type of risk. For multi-exposure derivatives, in cases of uncertainty, the deals shall be allocated according to the following order of precedence: (a) commodities: All derivatives transactions involving a commodity or commodity index exposure, whether or not they involve a joint exposure in commodities and any other risk category which may include foreign exchange, interest rate or equity, shall be reported in this category;EN L 97/ . (b) equities: With the exception of contracts with a joint exposure to commodities and equities, which are to be reported as commodities, all derivatives transactions with a link to the performance of equities or equity indices shall be reported in the equity category. Equity deals with exposure to foreign exchange or interest rates shall be included in this category; (c) foreign exchange and gold: This category shall include all derivatives transactions (with the exception of those already reported in the commodity or equity categories) with exposure to more than one currency, be it pertaining to either interest-bearing financial instruments or exchange rates, except where cross- currency swaps are used as part of a portfolio hedge of interest rate risk.. Amounts to be reported for derivatives 131. Under IFRS, the ‘carrying amount’ for all derivatives (hedging or trading) shall be the fair value. Derivatives with a positive fair value (above zero) shall be ‘financial assets’ and derivatives with a negative fair value (below zero) shall be ‘financial liabilities’. The ‘carrying amount’ shall be reported separately for derivatives with a positive fair value (‘financial assets’) and for those with a negative fair value (‘financial liabilities’). At the date of initial recognition, a derivative shall be classified as ‘financial asset’ or ‘financial liability’ according to its initial fair value. After initial recognition, as the fair value of a derivative increases or decreases, the terms of the exchange may become either favourable to the institution (and the derivative is classified as ‘financial asset’) or unfavourable (and the derivative is classified as ‘financial liability’). The carrying amount of hedging derivatives shall be their entire fair value, including, where applicable, the components of this fair value that are not designated as hedging instruments. 132. In addition to carrying amounts as defined in paragraph 27 of Part 1 of this Annex, fair values shall be reported by reporting institutions under national GAAP based on BAD for all derivative instruments, whether required to be booked on-balance sheet or off-balance sheet by the national GAAP based on BAD. 133. The ‘Notional amount’ shall be the gross nominal of all deals concluded and not yet settled at the reference date, regardless of whether those deals lead to derivative exposures being booked on-balance sheet. In particular, the following shall be taken into account to determine the notional amount: (a) for contracts with variable nominal or notional principal amounts, the basis for reporting shall be the nominal or notional principal amounts at the reference date; (b) the notional amount value to be reported for a derivative contract with a multiplier component shall be the contract effective notional amount or par value; (c) swaps: The notional amount of a swap shall be the underlying principal amount upon which the exchange of interest, foreign exchange or other income or expense is based; (d) equity and commodity-linked contracts: The notional amount to be reported for an equity or commodity contract shall be the quantity of the commodity or equity product contracted for purchase or sale multiplied by the contract price of a unit. The notional amount to be reported for commodity contracts with multiple exchanges of principal shall be the contractual amount multiplied by the number of remaining exchanges of principal in the contract; (e) credit derivatives: The contract amount to be reported for credit derivatives shall be the nominal value of the relevant reference credit; (f) digital options have a predefined payoff, which can be either a monetary amount or a number of contracts of an underlying. The notional amount for digital options shall be either the predefined monetary amount or the fair value of the underlying at the reference date.EN.  L 97/ 134. The column ‘Notional amount’ of derivatives shall include, for each line item, the sum of the notional amounts of all contracts in which the institution is counterparty, irrespective of whether the derivatives are considered assets or liabilities on the face of the balance sheet or are not booked on-balance sheet. All notional amounts shall be reported, regardless of whether the fair value of derivatives is positive, negative or equal to zero. Netting among the notional amounts shall not be allowed. 135. The ‘Notional amount’ shall be reported by ‘total’ and by ‘of which: sold’ for the line items: ‘OTC options’, ‘Organised market options’, ‘Credit’, ‘Commodity’ and ‘Other’. The item ‘of which sold’ shall include the notional amounts (strike price) of the contracts in which the counterparties (option holders) of the institution (option writer) have the right to exercise the option, and for the items related to credit risk derivatives, the notional amounts of the contracts in which the institution (protection seller) has sold (gives) protection to its counterparties (protection buyers). 136. The allocation of a transaction as ‘OTC’ or ‘Organized market’ shall be based on the nature of the market where the transaction takes place and not on whether there is a mandatory clearing obligation for that transaction. An ‘Organised market’ is a regulated market in the meaning of point (92) of Article 4(1) CRR. Therefore, where a reporting entity enters into a derivative contract in an OTC market where central clearing is compulsory, it shall classify that derivative as ‘OTC’ and not as ‘Organised market’.. Derivatives classified as ‘economic hedges’ 137. Derivatives that are held for hedging purposes but which do not meet the criteria to be effective hedging instruments in accordance with IFRS 9, with IAS 39 where IAS 39 is applied for hedge accounting purposes or with the accounting framework under national GAAP based on BAD, shall be reported in template 10 as ‘economic hedges’. This shall apply also to all of the following cases: (a) derivatives hedging unquoted equity instruments for which cost may be an appropriate estimate of fair value; (b) credit derivatives measured at fair value through profit or loss used to manage the credit risk of all, or part of, a financial instrument that is designated as measured at fair value through profit or loss at, or subsequent to, initial recognition, or while it is unrecognised in accordance with IFRS. ; (c) derivatives that are classified as ‘held for trading’ in accordance with Appendix A to IFRS 9 or classified as trading assets in accordance with the national GAAP based on BAD but are not part of the trading book as defined in point (86) of Article 4(1) CRR. 138. ‘Economic hedges’ shall not include derivatives for proprietary trading. 139. Derivatives that meet the definition of ‘economic hedges’ shall be reported separately in template 10 for each type of risk. 140. Credit derivatives used to manage the credit risk of all, or part of, a financial instrument that is designated as measured at fair value through profit or loss at, or subsequent to, initial recognition, or while it is unre cognised in accordance with IFRS , shall be reported in a dedicated row in template 10 within credit risk. Other economic hedges of credit risk for which the reporting entity does not apply IFRS shall be reported separately.EN L 97/ ..  Breakdown of derivatives by counterparty sector 141. The carrying amount and the total notional amount of derivatives held for trading, and also of derivatives held for hedge accounting, which are traded in the OTC market, shall be reported by counterparties using the following categories: (a) ‘credit institutions’; (b) ‘other financial corporations’; (c) ‘rest’ comprising all other counterparties. 142. All OTC derivatives, irrespective of the type of risk to which they are related, shall be broken down by those counterparties.. Hedge accounting under national GAAP () 143. Where national GAAP under BAD require the allocation of hedging derivatives across categories of hedges, the hedging derivatives shall be separately reported for each of the applicable categories: ‘fair-value hedges’, ‘cash flow hedges’, ‘cost-price hedges’, ‘hedge in net investments in a foreign operation’, ‘portfolio fair value hedges of interest rate risk’ and ‘portfolio cash flow hedges of interest rate risk’. 144. Where applicable in accordance with national GAAP based on BAD, ‘Cost price hedges’ shall refer to a hedging category in which the hedging derivative is generally measured at cost.. Amount to be reported for non-derivative hedging instruments ( and ) 145. For non-derivative hedging instruments, the amount to be reported shall be the carrying amount of those non-derivative hedging instruments according to the applicable measurement rules in IFRS or in GAAP based on BAD for the accounting portfolios to which they belong. No ‘notional amount’ shall be reported for non- derivative hedging instruments.. Hedged items in fair value hedges () 146. The carrying amount of hedged items in a fair value hedge recognised on the statement of financial position shall be broken down by accounting portfolio and type of hedged risk for hedged financial assets and hedged financial liabilities. Where a financial instrument is hedged for more than one risk, it shall be reported in the type of risk in which the hedging instrument shall be reported in accordance with paragraph 129. 147. ‘Micro-hedges’ shall be hedges other than portfolio hedge of interest rate risk in accordance with IAS A. Micro-hedges shall include hedges of nil net positions as referred to in accordance with IFRS. 148. ‘Hedge adjustments on micro-hedges’ shall include all hedge adjustments for all the micro-hedges as defined in paragraph 147.EN.  L 97/ 149. ‘Hedge adjustments included in the carrying amount of assets/liabilities’ shall be the accumulated amount of the gains and losses on the hedged items that have adjusted the carrying amount of those items and been recognised in profit or loss. Hedge adjustments for the hedged items that are equities measured at fair value through other comprehensive income shall be reported in template. Hedge adjustments for unrecognised firm commitments or a component thereof shall not be reported. 150. ‘Remaining adjustments for discontinued micro-hedges including hedges of net positions’ shall include those hedge adjustments which, following the discontinuation of the hedge relationship and the end of the adjustment of hedged items for hedging gains and losses, remain to be amortised to the profit or loss via a recalculated effective interest rate for hedged items measured at amortised cost, or to the amount that represents the previously recognised cumulative hedging gain or loss for hedged assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. 151. Where a group of financial assets or financial liabilities, including a group of financial assets or financial liabilities that constitute a net position, is eligible as a hedged item, financial assets and financial liabilities constituting that group shall be reported at their carrying amount on a gross basis, before netting between instruments within the group, in ‘Assets or liabilities included in hedge of a net position (before netting)’. 152. ‘Hedged items in portfolio hedge of interest rate risk’ shall include financial assets and financial liabilities included in a fair value hedge of the interest rate exposure of a portfolio of financial assets or financial liabilities. Those financial instruments shall be reported at their carrying amount on a gross basis, before netting between instruments within the portfolio.EN  . 11.

DERIVATIVES AND HEDGE ACCOUNTING (10 AND 11) 120. For the purpose of templates 10 and 11, derivatives shall be considered either as hedging derivatives where they are used in a qualifying hedging relationship in accordance with IFRS or with the applicable national GAAP under BAD, or as held for trading in other cases. 121. The carrying amount and the notional amount of the derivatives held for trading, including economic hedges, as well as the derivatives held for hedge accounting shall be reported broken down by type of underlying risk, type of market and type of product in templates 10 and 11. Institutions shall report the derivatives held for hedge accounting also broken down by type of hedge. Information on non-derivative hedging instruments shall be reported separately and broken down by types of hedges. 122. Under the relevant national GAAP based on BAD, all derivatives shall be reported in these templates irrespective of whether they are or are not recognised on the balance sheet under the relevant national GAAP. 123. The breakdown of the carrying amount, fair value and notional amount of trading and hedging derivatives by accounting portfolios and types of hedges shall be implemented taking into consideration the accounting portfolios and types of hedges that are applicable in IFRS or national GAAP under BAD, whichever framework applies to the reporting entity. 124. Trading derivatives and hedging derivatives which, in accordance with national GAAP based on BAD, are measured at cost or LOCOM shall be identified separately. 125. Template 11 shall include hedging instruments and hedged items irrespective of the accounting standard used to recognise a qualifying hedge relationship, including where that qualifying hedge relationship concerns a net position. Where an institution has elected to keep applying IAS 39 for hedge accounting (IFRS ), the references and names for the types of hedges and accounting portfolios shall be read as the relevant references and names in IAS : ‘Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income’ shall refer to ‘Available for sale assets’, and ‘Assets at amortised cost shall gather ‘Held to maturity’ as well as ‘Loans and receivables’. 126. Derivatives included in hybrid instruments, which have been separated from the host contract, shall be reported in templates 10 and 11 according to the nature of the derivative. The amount of the host contract is not included in those templates. However, where the hybrid instrument is measured at fair value through profit or loss, the contract shall be reported as a whole and the embedded derivatives shall not be reported in templates 10 and 11. 127. Commitments considered as derivatives (IFRS (b)) and credit derivatives that do not meet the definition of a financial guarantee in paragraph 114 of this Part of this Annex shall be reported in template 10 and template 11 following the same breakdowns as the other derivative instruments, but not be reported in template 9. 128. The carrying amount of non-derivative financial assets or non-derivative financial liabilities that are recognised as hedging instrument in application of IFRS or the relevant national GAAP under BAD shall be reported separately in template. EN.  L 97/. Classification of derivatives by type of risk 129. All derivatives shall be classified into one of the following risk categories: (a) interest rate: Interest rate derivatives shall be contracts related to an interest-bearing financial instrument the cash flows of which are determined by referencing interest rates or another interest rate contract such as an option on a futures contract to purchase a treasury bill. That category shall be restricted to those deals where all the legs are exposed to only one currency’s interest rate. It shall thus exclude contracts involving the exchange of one or more foreign currencies such as cross-currency swaps and currency options, and other contracts the predominant risk characteristic of which is foreign exchange risk, which are to be reported as foreign exchange contracts. The only exception is where cross-currency swaps are used as part of a portfolio hedge of interest rate risk, where they shall be reported in the dedicated rows for those types of hedges. Interest rate contracts shall include forward rate agreements, single-currency interest rate swaps, interest rate futures, interest rate options (including caps, floors, collars and corridors), interest rate swaps and interest rate warrants; (b) equity: Equity derivatives shall be contracts that have a return, or a portion of their return, linked to the price of a particular equity or to an index of equity prices; (c) foreign exchange and gold: These derivatives shall include contracts involving the exchange of currencies in the forward market and the exposure to gold. They shall therefore cover outright forwards, foreign exchange swaps, currency swaps (including cross-currency interest rate swaps), currency futures, currency options, currency swaps and currency warrants. Foreign exchange derivatives shall include all deals involving exposure to more than one currency, whether in exchange rates or in interest rates, except where cross-currency swaps are used as part of a portfolio hedge of interest rate risk. Gold contracts shall include all deals involving exposure to that commodity; (d) credit: Credit derivatives shall be contracts in which the payout is linked primarily to some measure of the creditworthiness of a particular reference credit and that do not meet the definition of financial guarantees (IFRS (c)). The contracts shall specify an exchange of payments in which at least one of the two legs is determined by the performance of the reference credit. Payouts can be triggered by a number of events, including a default, a rating downgrade or a stipulated change in the credit spread of the reference asset. Credit derivatives that meet the definition of a financial guarantee in paragraph 114 of this Part of this Annex shall be reported only in template 9; (e) commodity: These derivatives shall be contracts that have a return, or a portion of their return, linked to the price of, or to a price index of, a commodity such as a precious metal (other than gold), petroleum, lumber or agricultural products; (f) other: those derivatives shall be any other derivative contracts, which do not involve an exposure to foreign exchange, interest rate, equity, commodity or credit risk such as climatic derivatives or insurance derivatives. 130. Where a derivative is influenced by more than one type of underlying risk, the instrument shall be allocated to the most sensitive type of risk. For multi-exposure derivatives, in cases of uncertainty, the deals shall be allocated according to the following order of precedence: (a) commodities: All derivatives transactions involving a commodity or commodity index exposure, whether or not they involve a joint exposure in commodities and any other risk category which may include foreign exchange, interest rate or equity, shall be reported in this category;EN L 97/ . (b) equities: With the exception of contracts with a joint exposure to commodities and equities, which are to be reported as commodities, all derivatives transactions with a link to the performance of equities or equity indices shall be reported in the equity category. Equity deals with exposure to foreign exchange or interest rates shall be included in this category; (c) foreign exchange and gold: This category shall include all derivatives transactions (with the exception of those already reported in the commodity or equity categories) with exposure to more than one currency, be it pertaining to either interest-bearing financial instruments or exchange rates, except where cross- currency swaps are used as part of a portfolio hedge of interest rate risk.. Amounts to be reported for derivatives 131. Under IFRS, the ‘carrying amount’ for all derivatives (hedging or trading) shall be the fair value. Derivatives with a positive fair value (above zero) shall be ‘financial assets’ and derivatives with a negative fair value (below zero) shall be ‘financial liabilities’. The ‘carrying amount’ shall be reported separately for derivatives with a positive fair value (‘financial assets’) and for those with a negative fair value (‘financial liabilities’). At the date of initial recognition, a derivative shall be classified as ‘financial asset’ or ‘financial liability’ according to its initial fair value. After initial recognition, as the fair value of a derivative increases or decreases, the terms of the exchange may become either favourable to the institution (and the derivative is classified as ‘financial asset’) or unfavourable (and the derivative is classified as ‘financial liability’). The carrying amount of hedging derivatives shall be their entire fair value, including, where applicable, the components of this fair value that are not designated as hedging instruments. 132. In addition to carrying amounts as defined in paragraph 27 of Part 1 of this Annex, fair values shall be reported by reporting institutions under national GAAP based on BAD for all derivative instruments, whether required to be booked on-balance sheet or off-balance sheet by the national GAAP based on BAD. 133. The ‘Notional amount’ shall be the gross nominal of all deals concluded and not yet settled at the reference date, regardless of whether those deals lead to derivative exposures being booked on-balance sheet. In particular, the following shall be taken into account to determine the notional amount: (a) for contracts with variable nominal or notional principal amounts, the basis for reporting shall be the nominal or notional principal amounts at the reference date; (b) the notional amount value to be reported for a derivative contract with a multiplier component shall be the contract effective notional amount or par value; (c) swaps: The notional amount of a swap shall be the underlying principal amount upon which the exchange of interest, foreign exchange or other income or expense is based; (d) equity and commodity-linked contracts: The notional amount to be reported for an equity or commodity contract shall be the quantity of the commodity or equity product contracted for purchase or sale multiplied by the contract price of a unit. The notional amount to be reported for commodity contracts with multiple exchanges of principal shall be the contractual amount multiplied by the number of remaining exchanges of principal in the contract; (e) credit derivatives: The contract amount to be reported for credit derivatives shall be the nominal value of the relevant reference credit; (f) digital options have a predefined payoff, which can be either a monetary amount or a number of contracts of an underlying. The notional amount for digital options shall be either the predefined monetary amount or the fair value of the underlying at the reference date.EN.  L 97/ 134. The column ‘Notional amount’ of derivatives shall include, for each line item, the sum of the notional amounts of all contracts in which the institution is counterparty, irrespective of whether the derivatives are considered assets or liabilities on the face of the balance sheet or are not booked on-balance sheet. All notional amounts shall be reported, regardless of whether the fair value of derivatives is positive, negative or equal to zero. Netting among the notional amounts shall not be allowed. 135. The ‘Notional amount’ shall be reported by ‘total’ and by ‘of which: sold’ for the line items: ‘OTC options’, ‘Organised market options’, ‘Credit’, ‘Commodity’ and ‘Other’. The item ‘of which sold’ shall include the notional amounts (strike price) of the contracts in which the counterparties (option holders) of the institution (option writer) have the right to exercise the option, and for the items related to credit risk derivatives, the notional amounts of the contracts in which the institution (protection seller) has sold (gives) protection to its counterparties (protection buyers). 136. The allocation of a transaction as ‘OTC’ or ‘Organized market’ shall be based on the nature of the market where the transaction takes place and not on whether there is a mandatory clearing obligation for that transaction. An ‘Organised market’ is a regulated market in the meaning of point (92) of Article 4(1) CRR. Therefore, where a reporting entity enters into a derivative contract in an OTC market where central clearing is compulsory, it shall classify that derivative as ‘OTC’ and not as ‘Organised market’.. Derivatives classified as ‘economic hedges’ 137. Derivatives that are held for hedging purposes but which do not meet the criteria to be effective hedging instruments in accordance with IFRS 9, with IAS 39 where IAS 39 is applied for hedge accounting purposes or with the accounting framework under national GAAP based on BAD, shall be reported in template 10 as ‘economic hedges’. This shall apply also to all of the following cases: (a) derivatives hedging unquoted equity instruments for which cost may be an appropriate estimate of fair value; (b) credit derivatives measured at fair value through profit or loss used to manage the credit risk of all, or part of, a financial instrument that is designated as measured at fair value through profit or loss at, or subsequent to, initial recognition, or while it is unrecognised in accordance with IFRS. ; (c) derivatives that are classified as ‘held for trading’ in accordance with Appendix A to IFRS 9 or classified as trading assets in accordance with the national GAAP based on BAD but are not part of the trading book as defined in point (86) of Article 4(1) CRR. 138. ‘Economic hedges’ shall not include derivatives for proprietary trading. 139. Derivatives that meet the definition of ‘economic hedges’ shall be reported separately in template 10 for each type of risk. 140. Credit derivatives used to manage the credit risk of all, or part of, a financial instrument that is designated as measured at fair value through profit or loss at, or subsequent to, initial recognition, or while it is unre cognised in accordance with IFRS , shall be reported in a dedicated row in template 10 within credit risk. Other economic hedges of credit risk for which the reporting entity does not apply IFRS shall be reported separately.EN L 97/ ..  Breakdown of derivatives by counterparty sector 141. The carrying amount and the total notional amount of derivatives held for trading, and also of derivatives held for hedge accounting, which are traded in the OTC market, shall be reported by counterparties using the following categories: (a) ‘credit institutions’; (b) ‘other financial corporations’; (c) ‘rest’ comprising all other counterparties. 142. All OTC derivatives, irrespective of the type of risk to which they are related, shall be broken down by those counterparties.. Hedge accounting under national GAAP () 143. Where national GAAP under BAD require the allocation of hedging derivatives across categories of hedges, the hedging derivatives shall be separately reported for each of the applicable categories: ‘fair-value hedges’, ‘cash flow hedges’, ‘cost-price hedges’, ‘hedge in net investments in a foreign operation’, ‘portfolio fair value hedges of interest rate risk’ and ‘portfolio cash flow hedges of interest rate risk’. 144. Where applicable in accordance with national GAAP based on BAD, ‘Cost price hedges’ shall refer to a hedging category in which the hedging derivative is generally measured at cost.. Amount to be reported for non-derivative hedging instruments ( and ) 145. For non-derivative hedging instruments, the amount to be reported shall be the carrying amount of those non-derivative hedging instruments according to the applicable measurement rules in IFRS or in GAAP based on BAD for the accounting portfolios to which they belong. No ‘notional amount’ shall be reported for non- derivative hedging instruments.. Hedged items in fair value hedges () 146. The carrying amount of hedged items in a fair value hedge recognised on the statement of financial position shall be broken down by accounting portfolio and type of hedged risk for hedged financial assets and hedged financial liabilities. Where a financial instrument is hedged for more than one risk, it shall be reported in the type of risk in which the hedging instrument shall be reported in accordance with paragraph 129. 147. ‘Micro-hedges’ shall be hedges other than portfolio hedge of interest rate risk in accordance with IAS A. Micro-hedges shall include hedges of nil net positions as referred to in accordance with IFRS. 148. ‘Hedge adjustments on micro-hedges’ shall include all hedge adjustments for all the micro-hedges as defined in paragraph 147.EN.  L 97/ 149. ‘Hedge adjustments included in the carrying amount of assets/liabilities’ shall be the accumulated amount of the gains and losses on the hedged items that have adjusted the carrying amount of those items and been recognised in profit or loss. Hedge adjustments for the hedged items that are equities measured at fair value through other comprehensive income shall be reported in template. Hedge adjustments for unrecognised firm commitments or a component thereof shall not be reported. 150. ‘Remaining adjustments for discontinued micro-hedges including hedges of net positions’ shall include those hedge adjustments which, following the discontinuation of the hedge relationship and the end of the adjustment of hedged items for hedging gains and losses, remain to be amortised to the profit or loss via a recalculated effective interest rate for hedged items measured at amortised cost, or to the amount that represents the previously recognised cumulative hedging gain or loss for hedged assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. 151. Where a group of financial assets or financial liabilities, including a group of financial assets or financial liabilities that constitute a net position, is eligible as a hedged item, financial assets and financial liabilities constituting that group shall be reported at their carrying amount on a gross basis, before netting between instruments within the group, in ‘Assets or liabilities included in hedge of a net position (before netting)’. 152. ‘Hedged items in portfolio hedge of interest rate risk’ shall include financial assets and financial liabilities included in a fair value hedge of the interest rate exposure of a portfolio of financial assets or financial liabilities. Those financial instruments shall be reported at their carrying amount on a gross basis, before netting between instruments within the portfolio.EN.   12.

MOVEMENTS IN ALLOWANCES AND PROVISIONS FOR CREDIT LOSSES (12). Movements in allowances for credit losses and impairment of equity instruments under national GAAP based on BAD () 153. Template contains a reconciliation of the opening and closing balances of the allowance account for financial assets measured under cost-based methods, as well as for financial assets under other measurement methods or measured at fair value through equity where the national GAAP under BAD require those assets to be subject to impairment (including cash balances at central banks and other demand deposits). Value adjustments on assets measured at the lower of cost or market shall not be reported in template. 154. ‘Increases due to amounts set aside for estimated loan losses during the period’ shall be reported where, for the main category of assets or the counterparty, the estimation of the impairment for the period results in the recognition of net expenses; that is, for the given category or counterparty, the increases in the impairment for the period exceed the decreases. ‘Decreases due to amounts reversed for estimated loan losses during the period’ shall be reported where, for the main category of assets or counterparty, the estimation of the impairment for the period result in the recognition of net income; that is, for the given category or counterparty, the decreases in the impairment for the period exceed the increases. 155. Changes in the allowance amounts due to repayment and disposals of financial assets shall be reported in ‘Other adjustments’. Write-offs shall be reported in accordance with paragraphs 72 to 74.EN L 97/ ..  Movements in allowances and provisions for credit losses under IFRS () 156. Template contains a reconciliation of the opening and closing balances of the allowance account for financial assets measured at amortised cost and at fair value through other comprehensive income broken down by impairment stages, by instrument (including cash balances at central banks and other demand deposits) and by counterparty. A separate reconciliation for purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets shall be reported in the template. 157. The provisions for off-balance sheet exposures that are subject to the impairment requirements of IFRS 9 shall be reported by impairment stages and separately for purchased or originated credit-impaired exposures. Impairment for loan commitments shall be reported as provisions only where they are not considered together with the impairment of on-balance sheet assets in accordance with IFRS. B8E and paragraph 108 of this part. Movements in provisions for commitments and financial guarantees measured under IAS 37 and financial guarantees treated as insurance contracts under IFRS 4 shall not be reported in this template but in template 43. Changes in the fair value due to credit risk of commitments and financial guarantees measured at fair value through profit or loss in accordance with IFRS 9 shall not be reported in this template but in item ‘Gains or. losses on financial assets and liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss, net’ in accordance with paragraph 50 of this Part. 158. The items ‘of which: collectively measured allowances’ and ‘of which: individually measured allowances’ shall include the movements in the cumulative amount of impairment related to financial assets which have been measured on a collective or individual basis. 159. ‘Increases due to origination and acquisition’ shall include the amount of increases in expected losses accounted for on the initial recognition of financial assets originated or acquired. That increase of the allowance shall be reported at the first reporting reference date following the origination or acquisition of those financial assets. Increases or decreases in the expected losses on those financial assets after their initial recognition shall be reported in other columns. Originated or acquired assets shall include assets resulting from the drawdown of off-balance sheet commitments given. 160. ‘Decreases due to derecognition’ shall include the amount of changes in allowances due to financial assets de-recognised totally in the reporting reference period for reasons other than write-offs, which include transfers to third parties or the expiry of the contractual rights due to full repayment, disposal of those financial assets or their transfer in another accounting portfolio. The change in allowance shall be recognised in this column at the first reporting reference date following the repayment, disposal or transfer. For off-balance sheet exposures, this item shall also include the decreases in the impairment due to the off-balance sheet item becoming an on-balance sheet asset. 161. ‘Changes due to change in credit risk (net)’ shall include the net amount of changes in expected losses at the end of the reporting reference period due to an increase or decrease in credit risk since initial recognition, irrespective of whether those changes led to a transfer of the financial asset to another stage. The impact on the allowance due to the increase or decrease of the amount of financial assets as a consequence of the interest income accrued and paid shall be reported in this column. This item shall also include the impact of the passing of time on the expected losses calculated in accordance with IFRS (a) and (b). The changes in estimates due to updates or review of risk parameters as well as changes in forward-looking economic data shall also be reported in this column. Changes in expected losses due to partial repayment of exposures via instalments shall be reported in this column with the exception of the last instalment, which shall be reported in the column ‘Decreases due to derecognition’. 162. All changes in expected credit losses related to revolving exposures shall be reported in ‘Changes due to change in credit risk (net)’, except for those changes related to write-offs and updates in the institution’s methodology for estimation of credit losses. Revolving exposures shall be those for which customers’ outstanding balances are permitted to fluctuate based on their decisions to borrow and repay up to a limit established by the institution.EN.  L 97/ 163. ‘Changes due to an update in the institution’s methodology for estimation (net)’ shall include changes due to updates in the institution’s methodology for estimation of expected losses due to changes in the existing models or establishment of new models used to estimate impairment. Methodological updates shall also encompass the impact of the adoption of new standards. Changes in methodology that trigger an asset to change impairment stage shall be considered for a model change in its entirety. The changes in estimates due to updates or review of risk parameters as well as changes in forward-looking economic data shall not be reported in this column. 164. The reporting of the changes in the expected losses related to modified assets (IFRS and Appendix A) shall depend on the feature of the modification in accordance with the following: (a) where the modification results in the partial or total derecognition of an asset due to a write-off as defined in paragraph 74, the impact on expected losses due to this derecognition shall be reported in ‘Decrease in allowance account due to write-offs’, and any other impact from modification on expected credit losses in other appropriate columns; (b) where the modification results in the complete derecognition of an asset for reasons other than a write-off as defined in paragraph 74 and its substitution by a new asset, the impact of modification on expected credit losses shall be reported in ‘Changes due to derecognition’ for the changes due to the asset derecognised, and in ‘Increases due to origination and acquisition’ for the changes due to the newly recognised modified asset. Derecognition for reasons other than write-offs shall include dere cognition where the terms of the modified assets have been subject to substantial changes; (c) where the modification does not result in derecognition of all or part of the modified asset, its impact on expected losses shall be reported in ‘Changes due to modifications without derecognition’. 165. Write-offs shall be reported in accordance with paragraphs 72 to 74 of this Part of this Annex and in accordance with the following: (a) where the debt instrument is partially or totally derecognised because there is no reasonable expec tation of recovery, the decrease in the loss allowance reported due to the amounts written off shall be reported in: ‘Decrease in allowance account due to write-offs’; (b) ‘Amounts written-off directly to the statement of profit or loss’ shall be the amounts of financial assets written-off during the reporting reference period that exceed any allowance account of the respective financial assets at the derecognition date. They shall include all amounts written-off during the reporting reference period and not only those which are still subject to enforcement activity. 166. ‘Other adjustments’ shall include any amount not reported in the previous columns, including the adjustments on expected losses due to foreign exchange differences where it is consistent with the reporting of the impact of foreign exchange in template 2. 166i. ‘Gains or losses on derecognition of debt instruments’ shall include the difference between the carrying amount of financial assets measured at the date of derecognition and the consideration received.. Transfers between impairment stages (gross basis presentation) () 167. For financial assets included in the accounting portfolios and off-balance exposures, other than purchased or originated credit-impaired financialexposures, that are subject to the impairment requirements of IFRS 9, the gross carrying amount and the nominal amount that have been transferred between impairment stages during the reporting reference period shall be reported in template respectively. 168. Only the gross carrying amount or the nominal amount of those financial assets or off-balance exposures which are in a different impairment stage at the reporting reference date than they were at the beginning of the financial year or their initial recognition shall be reported. For on-balance exposures for which the impairment reported in template includes an off-balance sheet component (IFRS and IFRS 7.B8E), the change in stage of the on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet component shall be considered.EN L 97/ . 169. For the reporting of the transfers that have taken place during the financial year, financial assets or off- balance exposures that have changed multiple times the impairment stage since the beginning of the financial year or their initial recognition shall be reported as having been transferred from their impairment stage at the opening of the financial year or initial recognition to the impairment stage in which they are included at the reporting reference date. 170. The gross carrying amount or the nominal amount to be reported in template shall be the gross carrying amount or the nominal value at the reporting date, regardless of whether that amount was higher or lower at the date of the transfer.EN  . 43.

MOVEMENTS IN ALLOWANCES AND PROVISIONS FOR CREDIT LOSSES (12). Movements in allowances for credit losses and impairment of equity instruments under national GAAP based on BAD () 153. Template contains a reconciliation of the opening and closing balances of the allowance account for financial assets measured under cost-based methods, as well as for financial assets under other measurement methods or measured at fair value through equity where the national GAAP under BAD require those assets to be subject to impairment (including cash balances at central banks and other demand deposits). Value adjustments on assets measured at the lower of cost or market shall not be reported in template. 154. ‘Increases due to amounts set aside for estimated loan losses during the period’ shall be reported where, for the main category of assets or the counterparty, the estimation of the impairment for the period results in the recognition of net expenses; that is, for the given category or counterparty, the increases in the impairment for the period exceed the decreases. ‘Decreases due to amounts reversed for estimated loan losses during the period’ shall be reported where, for the main category of assets or counterparty, the estimation of the impairment for the period result in the recognition of net income; that is, for the given category or counterparty, the decreases in the impairment for the period exceed the increases. 155. Changes in the allowance amounts due to repayment and disposals of financial assets shall be reported in ‘Other adjustments’. Write-offs shall be reported in accordance with paragraphs 72 to 74.EN L 97/ ..  Movements in allowances and provisions for credit losses under IFRS () 156. Template contains a reconciliation of the opening and closing balances of the allowance account for financial assets measured at amortised cost and at fair value through other comprehensive income broken down by impairment stages, by instrument (including cash balances at central banks and other demand deposits) and by counterparty. A separate reconciliation for purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets shall be reported in the template. 157. The provisions for off-balance sheet exposures that are subject to the impairment requirements of IFRS 9 shall be reported by impairment stages and separately for purchased or originated credit-impaired exposures. Impairment for loan commitments shall be reported as provisions only where they are not considered together with the impairment of on-balance sheet assets in accordance with IFRS. B8E and paragraph 108 of this part. Movements in provisions for commitments and financial guarantees measured under IAS 37 and financial guarantees treated as insurance contracts under IFRS 4 shall not be reported in this template but in template 43. Changes in the fair value due to credit risk of commitments and financial guarantees measured at fair value through profit or loss in accordance with IFRS 9 shall not be reported in this template but in item ‘Gains or. losses on financial assets and liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss, net’ in accordance with paragraph 50 of this Part. 158. The items ‘of which: collectively measured allowances’ and ‘of which: individually measured allowances’ shall include the movements in the cumulative amount of impairment related to financial assets which have been measured on a collective or individual basis. 159. ‘Increases due to origination and acquisition’ shall include the amount of increases in expected losses accounted for on the initial recognition of financial assets originated or acquired. That increase of the allowance shall be reported at the first reporting reference date following the origination or acquisition of those financial assets. Increases or decreases in the expected losses on those financial assets after their initial recognition shall be reported in other columns. Originated or acquired assets shall include assets resulting from the drawdown of off-balance sheet commitments given. 160. ‘Decreases due to derecognition’ shall include the amount of changes in allowances due to financial assets de-recognised totally in the reporting reference period for reasons other than write-offs, which include transfers to third parties or the expiry of the contractual rights due to full repayment, disposal of those financial assets or their transfer in another accounting portfolio. The change in allowance shall be recognised in this column at the first reporting reference date following the repayment, disposal or transfer. For off-balance sheet exposures, this item shall also include the decreases in the impairment due to the off-balance sheet item becoming an on-balance sheet asset. 161. ‘Changes due to change in credit risk (net)’ shall include the net amount of changes in expected losses at the end of the reporting reference period due to an increase or decrease in credit risk since initial recognition, irrespective of whether those changes led to a transfer of the financial asset to another stage. The impact on the allowance due to the increase or decrease of the amount of financial assets as a consequence of the interest income accrued and paid shall be reported in this column. This item shall also include the impact of the passing of time on the expected losses calculated in accordance with IFRS (a) and (b). The changes in estimates due to updates or review of risk parameters as well as changes in forward-looking economic data shall also be reported in this column. Changes in expected losses due to partial repayment of exposures via instalments shall be reported in this column with the exception of the last instalment, which shall be reported in the column ‘Decreases due to derecognition’. 162. All changes in expected credit losses related to revolving exposures shall be reported in ‘Changes due to change in credit risk (net)’, except for those changes related to write-offs and updates in the institution’s methodology for estimation of credit losses. Revolving exposures shall be those for which customers’ outstanding balances are permitted to fluctuate based on their decisions to borrow and repay up to a limit established by the institution.EN.  L 97/ 163. ‘Changes due to an update in the institution’s methodology for estimation (net)’ shall include changes due to updates in the institution’s methodology for estimation of expected losses due to changes in the existing models or establishment of new models used to estimate impairment. Methodological updates shall also encompass the impact of the adoption of new standards. Changes in methodology that trigger an asset to change impairment stage shall be considered for a model change in its entirety. The changes in estimates due to updates or review of risk parameters as well as changes in forward-looking economic data shall not be reported in this column. 164. The reporting of the changes in the expected losses related to modified assets (IFRS and Appendix A) shall depend on the feature of the modification in accordance with the following: (a) where the modification results in the partial or total derecognition of an asset due to a write-off as defined in paragraph 74, the impact on expected losses due to this derecognition shall be reported in ‘Decrease in allowance account due to write-offs’, and any other impact from modification on expected credit losses in other appropriate columns; (b) where the modification results in the complete derecognition of an asset for reasons other than a write-off as defined in paragraph 74 and its substitution by a new asset, the impact of modification on expected credit losses shall be reported in ‘Changes due to derecognition’ for the changes due to the asset derecognised, and in ‘Increases due to origination and acquisition’ for the changes due to the newly recognised modified asset. Derecognition for reasons other than write-offs shall include dere cognition where the terms of the modified assets have been subject to substantial changes; (c) where the modification does not result in derecognition of all or part of the modified asset, its impact on expected losses shall be reported in ‘Changes due to modifications without derecognition’. 165. Write-offs shall be reported in accordance with paragraphs 72 to 74 of this Part of this Annex and in accordance with the following: (a) where the debt instrument is partially or totally derecognised because there is no reasonable expec tation of recovery, the decrease in the loss allowance reported due to the amounts written off shall be reported in: ‘Decrease in allowance account due to write-offs’; (b) ‘Amounts written-off directly to the statement of profit or loss’ shall be the amounts of financial assets written-off during the reporting reference period that exceed any allowance account of the respective financial assets at the derecognition date. They shall include all amounts written-off during the reporting reference period and not only those which are still subject to enforcement activity. 166. ‘Other adjustments’ shall include any amount not reported in the previous columns, including the adjustments on expected losses due to foreign exchange differences where it is consistent with the reporting of the impact of foreign exchange in template 2. 166i. ‘Gains or losses on derecognition of debt instruments’ shall include the difference between the carrying amount of financial assets measured at the date of derecognition and the consideration received.. Transfers between impairment stages (gross basis presentation) () 167. For financial assets included in the accounting portfolios and off-balance exposures, other than purchased or originated credit-impaired financialexposures, that are subject to the impairment requirements of IFRS 9, the gross carrying amount and the nominal amount that have been transferred between impairment stages during the reporting reference period shall be reported in template respectively. 168. Only the gross carrying amount or the nominal amount of those financial assets or off-balance exposures which are in a different impairment stage at the reporting reference date than they were at the beginning of the financial year or their initial recognition shall be reported. For on-balance exposures for which the impairment reported in template includes an off-balance sheet component (IFRS and IFRS 7.B8E), the change in stage of the on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet component shall be considered.EN L 97/ . 169. For the reporting of the transfers that have taken place during the financial year, financial assets or off- balance exposures that have changed multiple times the impairment stage since the beginning of the financial year or their initial recognition shall be reported as having been transferred from their impairment stage at the opening of the financial year or initial recognition to the impairment stage in which they are included at the reporting reference date. 170. The gross carrying amount or the nominal amount to be reported in template shall be the gross carrying amount or the nominal value at the reporting date, regardless of whether that amount was higher or lower at the date of the transfer.EN.   13.

COLLATERAL AND GUARANTEES RECEIVED (13). Breakdown of collateral and guarantees by loans and advances other than held for trading () 171. The collateral and guarantees backing the loans and advances included in the accounting portfolios, independently of their legal form, shall be reported by type of pledges: loans collateralised by immovable property and other collateralised loans, and by financial guarantees received. The loans and advances shall be broken down by counterparties and purpose. In the item ‘of which: non-performing’, loans and advances shall be reported as defined in paragraphs 213 to 239 or 260 of this Part. 172. In template , the ‘maximum amount of the collateral or guarantee that can be considered’ shall be reported. The sum of the amounts of the financial guarantee and/or collateral shown in the related columns of template shall not exceed the carrying amount of the related loan. 173. For reporting loans and advances according to the type of pledge, the following definitions shall be used: (a) within ‘Loans collateralised by immovable property’, ‘Residential’ shall include loans secured by resi dential immovable property and ‘Commercial’ loans secured by pledges of immovable property other than residential, including offices and commercial premises and other types of commercial immovable property. The determination of whether immovable property collateral shall be residential or commercial shall be made in accordance with point (75) of Article 4(1) CRR; (b) within ‘Other collateralised loans’: (i) ‘Cash, deposits, (Debt securities issued)’ shall include (a) deposits in the reporting institution that have been pledged as collateral for a loan and (b) debt securities issued by the reporting institution which have been pledged as collateral for a loan; (ii) ‘Movable property’ shall comprise pledges of physical collateral other than immovable property and include cars, airplanes, ships, industrial and mechanical equipment (machinery, mechanical and technical equipment), inventories and commodities (merchandise, finished and semi-finished products, raw materials) and other forms of movable property; (iii) ‘Equities and debt securities’ shall include collateral in the form of equity instruments, including investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, as well as in the form of debt securities issued by third parties; (iv) ‘Rest’ shall include pledges of assets; (c) ‘Financial guarantees received’ shall include contracts that in accordance with paragraph 114 of this Part of this Annex require the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the institution for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor failed to make a payment where due in accordance with the original or modified terms of a debt instrument.EN.  L 97/ 174. For loans and advances that have simultaneously several types of collateral or guarantee, the amount of the ‘Maximum collateral/guarantee that can be considered’ shall be allocated according to its quality, starting from the one with the best quality. For loans collateralised by immovable property, immovable property collateral shall always be reported first, irrespective of its quality compared to other collateral. Where the ‘Maximum collateral/guarantee that can be considered’ exceeds the value of immovable property collateral, its remaining value shall be allocated to other collateral types and guarantees according to its quality, starting from the one with best quality.. Collateral obtained by taking possession during the period (held at the reference date) () 175. This template shall be used to report information on collateral that has been obtained between the beginning and the end of the reference period and that remains recognised in the balance sheet at the reference date. Collateral obtained by taking possession shall include assets that were not pledged by the debtor as collateral, but were obtained in exchange for the cancellation of debt, whether on a voluntary basis or as part of legal proceedings. The types of collateral shall be the ones referred to in paragraph 173, with the exception of those in point (b) (i) of that paragraph. 175i. ‘Value at initial recognition’ shall mean the gross carrying amount of the collateral obtained by taking possession at the point in time of the initial recognition in the balance sheet of the reporting institution. 175ii. ‘Accumulated negative changes’ shall be the difference, at the level of the individual collateral item, between the value at initial recognition of the collateral and the carrying amount at the reporting reference date, where that difference is negative.. Collateral obtained by taking possession accumulated () 176. Collateral obtained by taking possession that remains recognised in the balance sheet at the reference date, irrespective of the point in time when it was obtained, shall be reported in template. Both collateral obtained by taking possession classified as ‘Property, plant and equipment’ and other collateral obtained by taking possession shall be included. Collateral obtained by taking possession shall include assets that were not pledged by the debtor as collateral, but were obtained in exchange for the cancellation of debt, whether on a voluntary basis or as part of legal proceedings. 13. FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY: FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AT FAIR VALUE (14) 177. Institutions shall report the value of financial instruments measured at fair value according to the hierarchy provided by IFRS. Where national GAAP under BAD require the allocation of assets measured at fair value between different levels of fair value, institutions under national GAAP shall also report this template. 178. ‘Change in fair value for the period’ shall include gains or losses from re-measurements made in accordance with IFRS 9, IFRS 13 or national GAAP, where applicable, in the period of the instruments that continue to exist at the reporting date. Those gains and losses shall be reported as for inclusion in the statement of profit or loss, or where applicable, in the statement of comprehensive income; thus, the amounts to be reported are before taxes. 179. ‘Accumulated change in fair value before taxes’ shall include the amount of gains or losses from re- measurements of the instruments accumulated from the initial recognition to the reference date. 14. DERECOGNITION AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH TRANSFERRED FINANCIAL ASSETS (15) 180. Template 15 shall include information on transferred financial assets of which part or all do not qualify for derecognition, and financial assets entirely derecognised for which the institution retains servicing rights. 181. The associated liabilities shall be reported according to the portfolio in which the related transferred financial assets were included in the assets side and not according to the portfolio in which they were included in the liability side.EN L 97/ .EN.   14.

DERECOGNITION AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH TRANSFERRED FINANCIAL ASSETS (15) 180. Template 15 shall include information on transferred financial assets of which part or all do not qualify for derecognition, and financial assets entirely derecognised for which the institution retains servicing rights. 181. The associated liabilities shall be reported according to the portfolio in which the related transferred financial assets were included in the assets side and not according to the portfolio in which they were included in the liability side.EN L 97/ . 182. The column ‘Amounts derecognised for capital purposes’ shall include the carrying amount of the financial assets recognised for accounting purposes but de-recognised for prudential purposes because the insti tution is treating them as securitisation positions for capital purposes in accordance with Articles 109, 243 and 244 CRR. 183. ‘Repurchase agreements’ (‘repos’) shall be transactions in which the institution receives cash in exchange for financial assets sold at a given price under a commitment to repurchase the same (or identical) assets at a fixed price on a specified future date. Transactions involving the temporary transfer of gold against cash collateral shall also be considered ‘Repurchase agreements’ (‘repos’). Amounts received by the insti tution in exchange for financial assets transferred to a third party (‘temporary acquirer’) shall be classified under ‘repurchase agreements’ where there is a commitment to reverse the operation and not merely an option to do so. Repurchase agreements shall also include repo-type operations which may include: (a) amounts received in exchange for securities temporarily transferred to a third party in the form of securities lending against cash collateral; (b) amounts received in exchange for securities temporarily transferred to a third party in the form of sale/buy-back agreement. 184. ‘Repurchase agreements’ (‘repos’) and ‘reverse repurchase loans’ (‘reverse repos’) shall involve cash received or loaned out by the institution. 185. In a securitisation transaction, where the transferred financial assets are derecognized, institutions shall declare the gains (losses) generated by the item within the income statement corresponding to the ‘accounting portfolios’ in which the financial assets were included prior to their derecognition.EN  . 16.

Interest expenses shall be broken down in accordance with both of the following: (a) interest expenses on financial liabilities included in the accounting portfolios and other liabilities; (b) interest expenses on financial assets with negative effective interest rate. 189. Interest income on financial assets and on financial liabilities with a negative effective interest rate shall include interest income on derivatives held for trading, debt securities, and loans and advances, as well as on deposits, debt securities issued and other financial liabilities with a negative effective interest rate. 190. Interest expenses on financial liabilities and on financial assets with a negative effective interest rate shall include interest expenses on derivatives held for trading, deposits, debt securities issued and other financial liabilities, as well as on debt securities and loans and advances with a negative effective interest rate. 191.

All instruments in the various portfolios shall be taken into account except those included in the items ‘Derivatives – Hedge accounting’ not used to hedge interest rate risk.EN.  L 97/ 192. ‘Derivatives – Hedge accounting, interest rate risk’ shall include the interest income and expenses on hedging instruments where the hedged items generate interest. 193. Where the clean price is used, interest on derivatives held for trading shall include the amounts related to those derivatives held for trading which qualify as ‘economic hedges’ that are included as interest income or expenses to correct the income and expense of the hedged financial instruments from an economic but not accounting point of view. In such case, interest income on economic hedge derivatives shall be reported separately within interest income from trading derivatives. Time-apportioned fees or balancing payments in relation to credit derivatives measured at fair value and used to manage the credit risk of part or all of a financial instrument that is designated at fair value at that occasion shall also be reported within interest on derivatives held for trading. 194. Under IFRS, ‘Of which: interest-income on impaired financial assets’ means interest income on credit-impaired financial assets, including purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets where the latter are considered as non-performing in accordance with paragraph 215 of this Part.

Gains or losses on derecognition of financial assets and liabilities not measured at fair value through profit or loss by instrument () 195. Gains and losses on derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities not measured at fair value through profit or loss shall be broken down by type of financial instrument and by accounting portfolio. For each item, the net realised gain or loss stemming from the derecognised transaction shall be reported. The net amount represents the difference between realised gains and realised losses. 196. Template shall apply under IFRS to financial assets and liabilities at amortised cost, and debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income.

NON-PERFORMING EXPOSURES (18). Information on performing and non-performing exposures () 213. For the purposes of template 18, non-performing exposures shall be exposures listed in Article 47a(3) CRR. 215. Under IFRS, for the purpose of template 18, impaired exposures shall be those that have been found credit-impaired (Stage 3). Exposures included in impairment stages other than Stage 3 and those that are purchased or originated credit-impaired shall be considered as non-performing where they meet the criteria to be considered as non-performing in accordance with Article 47a(3) CRR. 216. Exposures shall be categorised for their entire amount and without taking into account the existence of any collateral. With reference to the exposures referred to in point (a) of Article 47a(3) CRR, materiality shall be assessed in accordance with Article 178 CRR and the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) /171 (RTS on materiality threshold for credit obligations past due).EN.  L 97/ 217. For the purpose of template 18, ‘exposures’ shall include all debt instruments (debt securities and loans and advances, including cash balances at central banks and other demand deposits) and off-balance sheet exposures, except those held for trading exposures. 218. Debt instruments shall be included in the following accounting portfolios: (a) debt instruments at cost or amortised cost; (b) debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income or through equity subject to impairment; and (c) debt instruments at strict LOCOM or fair value through profit or loss or through equity not subject to impairment, in accordance with the criteria of paragraph 233 of this Part. Each category shall be broken down by instrument and by counterparty. 219. Under IFRS and relevant national GAAP based on BAD, off-balance sheet exposures shall comprise the following revocable and irrevocable items: (a) loan commitments given; (b) financial guarantees given; (c) other commitments given. 220. Debt instruments classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 shall be reported separately. 221. In template 18 for debt instruments, ‘gross carrying amount’ as defined in paragraph 34of Part 1 of this Annex shall be reported. For off-balance sheet exposures, the nominal amount as defined in paragraph 118 of this Annex shall be reported. 222. For the purpose of template 18, an exposure is ‘past-due’ where it meets the criteria of paragraph 96 of this Part. For the purpose of classification of exposures as non-performing in accordance with point (a) of Article 47a(3) CRR, the counting of 90 days past due commences once the past due amount, being the sum of past due principal, interest and fees, breaches the materiality threshold as defined in paragraph 216 of this Part. If the past due part of exposures continues to be material for 90 consecutive days, the exposure should then be classified as non-performing. 223. For the purpose of template 18, ‘debtor’ shall mean an obligor within the meaning of Article 178 CRR. 226. Exposures classified as non-performing in accordance with paragraph 213 shall be categorised as either non-performing on an individual basis (‘transaction based’) or as non-performing for the overall exposure to a given debtor (‘debtor based’). For the categorisation of non-performing exposures on an individual basis or to a given debtor, the following categorisation approaches shall be used for the different types of non-performing exposures: (a) for non-performing exposures classified as defaulted in accordance with Article 178 CRR, the categori sation approach of that Article shall be applied; (b) for exposures that are classified as non-performing due to impairment under the applicable accounting framework, the recognition criteria for impairment under the applicable accounting framework shall be applied; (c) for other non-performing exposures that are neither classified as defaulted nor as impaired, the provisions of Article 178 CRR for defaulted exposures shall be applied. 227. Where an institution has on-balance sheet exposures to a debtor that are past due by more than 90 days and the gross carrying amount of the past due exposures represents more than 20 % of the gross carrying amount of all on-balance sheet exposures to that debtor, all on- and off-balance sheet exposures to that debtor shall be considered as non-performing. Where a debtor belongs to a group, the need to consider also exposures to other entities of the group as non-performing shall be assessed, except for exposures affected by isolated disputes that are unrelated to the solvency of the counterparty.EN L 97/ . 228. Exposures shall be considered to have ceased being non-performing where all of the conditions provided in Article 47a(4) CRR are met. 230. The classification of a non-performing exposure as non-current asset held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 shall not discontinue their classification as non-performing exposure in accordance with Article 47a(5) CRR. 231. Granting forbearance measures to a non-performing exposure shall not discontinue the non-performing status of this exposure. Where exposures are non-performing with forbearance measures, as referred to in paragraph 262, those exposures shall be considered to have ceased being non-performing where all the conditions provided in Article 47a(6) CRR are met. 232. Where the conditions referred to in paragraph 231 of this Part of this Annex are not met at the end of the one year period specified in point (b) of Article 47a(6) CRR, the exposure shall continue to be identified as non-performing forborne exposure until all conditions are met. The conditions shall be assessed at least on a quarterly basis. 233. The accounting portfolios under IFRS listed in paragraph 15 of Part 1 of this Annex and under relevant national GAAP based on BAD listed in paragraph 16 of Part 1 of this Annex shall be reported as follows in template 18: (a) ‘Debt instruments at cost or at amortised cost’ shall encompass debt instruments included in any of the following: (i) ‘Financial assets at amortised cost’ (IFRS); (ii) ‘Non-trading non-derivative financial assets at a cost based method’, including debt instruments under moderate LOCOM (national GAAP based on BAD); (iii) ‘Other non-trading non-derivative financial assets’, except debt instruments measured at strict LOCOM (national GAAP based on BAD); (b) ‘Debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income or through equity subject to impairment’ shall encompass debt instruments included in any of the following: (i) ‘Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income’ (IFRS); (ii) ‘Non-trading non-derivative financial assets measured at fair value to equity’, where instruments in that measurement category can be subject to impairment in accordance with the applicable accounting framework under national GAAP based on BAD; (c) ‘Debt instruments at strict LOCOM, or at fair value through profit or loss or through equity not subject to impairment’ shall encompass debt instruments included in any of the following: (i) ‘Non-trading financial assets mandatorily at fair value through profit or loss’ (IFRS); (ii) ‘Financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss’ (IFRS); (iii) ‘Non-trading non-derivative financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss’ (national GAAP based on BAD); (iv) ‘Other non-trading non-derivative financial assets’ where debt instruments are measured under strict LOCOM (national GAAP based on BAD); (v) ‘Non-trading non-derivative financial assets measured at fair value through equity’, where debt instruments in that measurement category are not subject to impairment in accordance with the applicable accounting framework under GAAP based on BAD.EN.

Where IFRS or the relevant national GAAP based on BAD provide for the designation of commitments at fair value through profit and loss, the carrying amount of any asset resulting from that designation and measurement at fair value shall be reported in ‘Financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss’ (IFRS) or ‘Non-trading non-derivative financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss’ (national GAAP based on BAD). The carrying amount of any liability resulting from that designation shall not be reported in template 18. The notional amount of all commitments designated at fair value through profit or loss shall be reported in template 9. 234i. The following exposures shall be identified in separate rows: (a) Loans collateralised by immovable property as defined in paragraphs 86(a) and 87of this Part; (b) Credit for consumption as defined in paragraph 88(a) of this Part. 235. Past due exposures shall be reported separately within the performing and non-performing categories for their entire amount as defined in paragraph 96 of this Part. Exposures past due by more than 90 days but that are not material in accordance with Article 178 CRR shall be reported within performing exposures in ‘Past due > 30 days <= 90 days’. 236. Non-performing exposures shall be reported broken down by past due time bands. In case of application of the debtor approach for the classification of exposures as non-performing referred to in paragraph 226 of this Part of this Annex, the exposures of the debtor shall be reported in the past-due time bands of non-performing in accordance with their individual past-due status. Exposures that are not past due or are past due by 90 days or less, but are nevertheless identified as non-performing due to the likelihood of non-full repayment, shall be reported in a dedicated column. Exposures that present both past due amounts and a likelihood of non-full repayment shall be allocated by past-due time bands consistent with the number of days that they are past due. 237. The following exposures shall be identified in separate columns: (a) exposures which are considered to be impaired in accordance with the applicable accounting framework; under IFRS, the amount of credit-impaired assets (Stage 3) which does not include purchased or originated credit impaired assets, shall be reported; under national GAAP, the amount of impaired assets shall be reported; (b) exposures in respect of which a default is considered to have occurred in accordance with Article 178 CRR; (c) under IFRS, assets with significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, but not credit- impaired (Stage 2) which do not include purchased or originated credit impaired assets; (d) under IFRS, for performing exposures, assets without significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition (Stage 1); (e) exposures which are considered as purchased or originated financial assets that are credit-impaired at initial recognition in accordance with IFRS 9 Appendix A, including any off-balance sheet exposures that are deemed credit-impaired upon their initial recognition; (f) for performing exposures, the amount of accumulated impairment for exposures past due by more than 30 days. 238. Accumulated impairment, accumulated negative changes in fair value due to credit risk and provisions shall be reported in accordance with paragraphs 11, 69 to 71, 106 and 110of this Part. 239. Information on collateral held and guarantees received on performing and non-performing exposures shall be reported separately. Amounts reported for collateral received and guarantees received shall be calculated in accordance with paragraphs 172 and 174of this Part. The sum of the amounts reported for both collateral and guarantees shall be capped at the carrying amount or nominal amount after deduction of provisions of the related exposure.EN L 97/ ..  Inflows and outflows of non-performing exposures – loans and advances by counterparty sector () 239i. Template shall provide the inflows and outflows of loans and advances, excluding loans and advances classified as trading financial assets or held for trading, that were classified into or out of the category of non-performing exposures as defined in paragraphs 213 to 239 or 260of this Part. Inflows and outflows of non-performing loans and advances shall be broken down by counterparty sector. 239ii. Inflows to the non-performing exposures category shall be reported on a cumulative basis since the beginning of the financial year. The inflow shall reflect the gross carrying amount of exposures that have become non-performing as defined in paragraphs 213 to 239 or 260 of this Part during the period, including purchased non-performing exposures. An increase in the gross carrying amount of a non- performing exposure due to accrued interest or due to an increase in the accumulated negative changes in fair value due to credit risk shall be reported as an inflow as well. 239iii. For an exposure that during the period has been reclassified multiple times from non-performing to performing or vice versa, the amount of inflows and outflows shall be identified based on a comparison between the status of the exposure (performing or non-performing) at the beginning of the financial year or at initial recognition and its status at the reporting reference date. 239iv. Outflows from the non-performing exposures category shall be reported on a cumulative basis since the beginning of the financial year. The outflow shall reflect the sum of the gross carrying amounts of exposures that cease to be non-performing during the period, and, where applicable, shall include the amount of write-offs made in the context of the partial or full derecognition of the exposure. A decrease in the gross carrying amount of a non-performing exposure due to interest paid or a decrease in the accumulated negative changes in fair value due to credit risk shall be reported as an outflow as well. 239v. An outflow shall be reported in the following cases: (a) a non-performing exposure meets the criteria for ceasing to be classified as non-performing as laid out in paragraphs 228 – 232 of this Part and is reclassified as performing not forborne or performing forborne; (b) a non-performing exposure is partially or totally repaid; in case of partial repayment, only the repaid amount shall be classified as outflow; (c) collateral is liquidated, including outflows due to other liquidation or legal procedures, such as the liquidation of assets other than collateral obtained via legal procedures, and the voluntary sale of the collateral; (d) the institution takes possession of the collateral as referred in paragraph 175 of this Part including cases of debt asset swaps, voluntary surrenders and debt equity swaps; (e) a non-performing exposure is sold; (f) the risk pertaining to a non-performing exposure is transferred and the exposure meets the criteria to be derecognised; (g) a non-performing exposure is written-off partially or totally; in case of partial write-offs, only the written-off amount shall be classified as outflow; (h) a non-performing exposure, or parts of a non-performing exposure, ceases to be non-performing for other reasons.EN.  L 97/ 239vi. The reclassification of a non-performing exposure from one accounting portfolio to another shall be reported neither as inflow nor as outflow. As an exception, the reclassification of a non-performing exposure from any accounting portfolio to ‘held for sale’ shall be reported as outflow from the original accounting portfolio and inflow to ‘held for sale’. 239vii. The following exposures shall be identified in separate rows: (a) commercial real estate (CRE) loans as defined in paragraph 239ix, broken down into CRE loans to SMEs and CRE loans to non-financial corporations other than SMEs; (b) loans collateralised by immovable property as defined in paragraphs 86(a) and 87of this Part; (c) credit for consumption as defined in paragraph 88(a) of this Part.. Commercial Real Estate (CRE) loans and additional information on loans secured by immovable property () 239viii. Template shall present information on commercial real estate loans to non-financial corporations and on loans collateralised by commercial or residential immovable property to non-financial corporations and households respectively, broken down by loan to value ratio (LTV ratio). Loans and advances classified as held for trading, trading financial assets and debt instruments held for sale shall be excluded. 239ix. ‘Commercial real estate (CRE) loans’ shall comprise exposures as defined in section 2, chapter 1, paragraph 1 of the ESRB Recommendation on closing real estate data gaps ( 8 ). 239x. The LTV ratio shall be calculated in accordance with the method for the calculation of the ‘current loan-to- value ratio’ (LTV-C) laid down in section 2, chapter 1, paragraph 1 of the ESRB Recommendation on closing real estate data gaps. 239xi. Information on collateral received and financial guarantees received on loans shall be reported in accordance with paragraph 239of this Part. Consequently, the sum of the amounts reported for both collateral and guarantees shall be capped at the carrying amount of the related exposure.EN  . 19.

FORBORNE EXPOSURES (19) 240. For the purpose of template 19, forborne exposures shall be debt contracts in respect of which forbearance measures as defined in Article 47b(1) and (2) CRR have been applied. 243. Forbearance measures also include the exercise of clauses which, where used at the discretion of the debtor, enable the debtor to change the terms of the contract (‘embedded forbearance clauses’) and which shall be treated as a concession where the institution approves executing those clauses and concludes that the debtor is experiencing financial difficulties. 244. For the purposes of Annexes III and IV as well as this Annex, ‘refinancing’ shall mean the use of debt contracts to ensure the total or partial payment of other debt contracts the terms of which the debtor is unable to comply with. 245. For the purpose of template 19, ‘debtor’ means an obligor within the meaning of Article 47b(4) CRR. 246. For the purpose of template 19, ‘debt’ shall include loans and advances (including also cash balances at central banks and other demand deposits), debt securities and revocable and irrevocable loan commitments given, including those loan commitments that are designated at fair value through profit and loss that are assets at the reporting date. ‘Debt’ shall exclude exposures held for trading. 247. ‘Debt’ shall also include loans and advances and debt securities classified as non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5.EN L 97/ . ( 8 ) Recommendation of the European Systemic Risk Board of 31 October on closing real estate data gaps (ESRB//14), OJ C 31,. , p. 1. 248. For the purposes of template 19, ‘exposure’ shall have the same meaning as ‘debt’ in paragraphs 246 and 247 of this Part. 249. The accounting portfolios under IFRS listed in paragraph 15 of Part 1 of this Annex and under relevant national GAAP based on BAD listed in paragraph 16 of Part 1 of this Annex shall be reported in template 19 in accordance with paragraph 233 of this Part. 250. For the purposes of template 19, ‘institution’ shall mean the institution, which applied the forbearance measures. 251. In template 19 for ‘debt’, the ‘gross carrying amount’ shall be reported in accordance with paragraph 34 of Part 1 of this Annex. For loan commitments given which are off-balance sheet exposures, the nominal amount as defined in paragraph 118 of this Part of this Annex shall be reported. 252. Exposures shall be regarded as forborne where a concession has been made in accordance with Article 47b(1) CRR, irrespective of whether any amount is past due or of the classification of the exposures as impaired in accordance with the applicable accounting framework or as defaulted in accordance with Article 178 CRR. Exposures shall not be treated as forborne where the debtor is not in financial difficulties. Under IFRS, modified financial assets (IFRS and Appendix A) shall be treated as forborne where a concession as defined in Article 47b(1) CRR has been made, regardless of the incidence of the modification on the change in the credit risk of the financial asset since initial recog nition. 254. There is a rebuttable presumption that forbearance has taken place in any of the circumstances listed in Article 47b(3) CRR. 255. Financial difficulties shall be assessed at debtor level as referred to in paragraph 245. Only exposures to which forbearance measures have been applied shall be identified as forborne exposures. 256. Forborne exposures shall be included in the non-performing exposures category or the performing exposures category in accordance with paragraphs 213 to 239 and 260 of this Part. The classification as forborne exposure shall be discontinued where all of the conditions provided in Article 47a(7) CRR are met. 257. Where the conditions referred to in Article 47a(7) CRR are not met at the end of the probation period, the exposure shall continue to be identified as performing forborne under probation until all the conditions are met. The conditions shall be assessed at least on a quarterly basis. 258. Forborne exposures, which are classified as non-current assets held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5, shall continue to be classified as forborne exposures. 259. A forborne exposure may be considered as performing from the date the forbearance measures were applied where both of the following conditions are met: (a) that extension has not led the exposure to be classified as non-performing; (b) the exposure was not considered to be a non-performing exposure at the date the forbearance measures were extended. 260. Where additional forbearance measures are applied to a performing forborne exposure under probation that has been reclassified out of non-performing category or the forborne exposure under probation reclassified out of non-performing category becomes more than 30 days past due, the exposure shall be classified as non-performing in accordance with point (c) of Article 47a(3) CRR.EN.  L 97/ 261. ‘Performing exposures with forbearance measures’ (performing forborne exposures) shall comprise forborne exposures that do not meet the criteria to be considered as non-performing and that are included in the performing exposures category. Performing forborne exposures shall be under probation until all the criteria laid down in Article 47a(7) CRR, including where paragraph 259 of this Part applies, are met. Performing forborne exposures under probation that have been reclassified out of the non-performing forborne exposures category shall be reported separately within the performing exposures with forbearance measures in the column ‘of which: Performing forborne exposures under probation reclassified from non-performing’. 262. ‘Non-performing exposures with forbearance measures’ (non-performing forborne exposures) shall comprise forborne exposures that meet the criteria to be considered as non-performing and that are included in the non-performing exposures category. Those non-performing forborne exposures shall include the following: (a) exposures which have become non-performing due to the application of forbearance measures; (b) exposures which were non-performing prior to the extension of forbearance measures; (c) forborne exposures which have been reclassified from the performing category, including exposures reclassified in application of paragraph 260. 263. Where forbearance measures are extended to exposures which were non-performing prior to the extension of forbearance measures, the amount of those forborne exposures shall be separately identified in the column ‘of which: forbearance of exposures non-performing prior to forbearance measures’. 264. The following non-performing exposures with forbearance measures shall be identified in separate columns: (a) exposures which are considered, in accordance with the applicable accounting framework, to be impaired. Under IFRS, the amount of credit-impaired assets (Stage 3) and the amount of purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets where they are considered as non-performing in accordance with paragraph 215 of this Part shall be reported in this column; (b) exposures in respect of which a default is considered to have occurred in accordance with Article 178 CRR. 265. The column ‘Refinancing’ shall comprise the gross carrying amount of the new contract (‘refinancing debt’) granted as part of a refinancing transaction which qualifies as a forbearance measure, as well as the gross carrying amount of the old re-paid contract that is still outstanding. 266. Forborne exposures combining modifications and refinancing shall be allocated to the column ‘Instruments with modifications of the terms and conditions’ or the column ‘Refinancing’, depending on the measure that has the most impact on cash flows. Refinancing by a pool of banks shall be reported in the column ‘Refinancing’ for the total amount of refinancing debt provided by or refinanced debt still outstanding at the reporting institution. Repackaging of several debts into a new debt shall be reported as a modification, unless there is also a refinancing transaction that has a larger impact on cash flows. Where forbearance through modification of the terms and conditions of a troubled exposure leads to that exposure’s derecognition and to the recognition of a new exposure, that new exposure shall be treated as forborne debt. 267. Accumulated impairment, accumulated negative changes in fair value due to credit risk and provisions shall be reported in accordance with paragraphs 11, 69 to 71, 106 and 110 of this Part.EN L 97/ . 268. Collateral and guarantees received on exposures with forbearance measures shall be reported for all exposures with forbearance measures, regardless of their performing or non-performing status. In addition, collateral and financial guarantees received on non-performing exposures with forbearance measures shall be shown separately. Amounts reported for collateral received and guarantees received shall be calculated in accordance with paragraphs 172 and 174 of this Part. The sum of the amounts reported for both collateral and guarantees shall be capped at the carrying amount of the related on- balance sheet exposure or nominal amount after deduction of provisions of the related off-balance sheet exposure.EN.   18.

NON-PERFORMING EXPOSURES (18). Information on performing and non-performing exposures () 213. For the purposes of template 18, non-performing exposures shall be exposures listed in Article 47a(3) CRR. 215. Under IFRS, for the purpose of template 18, impaired exposures shall be those that have been found credit-impaired (Stage 3). Exposures included in impairment stages other than Stage 3 and those that are purchased or originated credit-impaired shall be considered as non-performing where they meet the criteria to be considered as non-performing in accordance with Article 47a(3) CRR. 216. Exposures shall be categorised for their entire amount and without taking into account the existence of any collateral. With reference to the exposures referred to in point (a) of Article 47a(3) CRR, materiality shall be assessed in accordance with Article 178 CRR and the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) /171 (RTS on materiality threshold for credit obligations past due).EN.  L 97/ 217. For the purpose of template 18, ‘exposures’ shall include all debt instruments (debt securities and loans and advances, including cash balances at central banks and other demand deposits) and off-balance sheet exposures, except those held for trading exposures. 218. Debt instruments shall be included in the following accounting portfolios: (a) debt instruments at cost or amortised cost; (b) debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income or through equity subject to impairment; and (c) debt instruments at strict LOCOM or fair value through profit or loss or through equity not subject to impairment, in accordance with the criteria of paragraph 233 of this Part. Each category shall be broken down by instrument and by counterparty. 219. Under IFRS and relevant national GAAP based on BAD, off-balance sheet exposures shall comprise the following revocable and irrevocable items: (a) loan commitments given; (b) financial guarantees given; (c) other commitments given. 220. Debt instruments classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 shall be reported separately. 221. In template 18 for debt instruments, ‘gross carrying amount’ as defined in paragraph 34of Part 1 of this Annex shall be reported. For off-balance sheet exposures, the nominal amount as defined in paragraph 118 of this Annex shall be reported. 222. For the purpose of template 18, an exposure is ‘past-due’ where it meets the criteria of paragraph 96 of this Part. For the purpose of classification of exposures as non-performing in accordance with point (a) of Article 47a(3) CRR, the counting of 90 days past due commences once the past due amount, being the sum of past due principal, interest and fees, breaches the materiality threshold as defined in paragraph 216 of this Part. If the past due part of exposures continues to be material for 90 consecutive days, the exposure should then be classified as non-performing. 223. For the purpose of template 18, ‘debtor’ shall mean an obligor within the meaning of Article 178 CRR. 226. Exposures classified as non-performing in accordance with paragraph 213 shall be categorised as either non-performing on an individual basis (‘transaction based’) or as non-performing for the overall exposure to a given debtor (‘debtor based’). For the categorisation of non-performing exposures on an individual basis or to a given debtor, the following categorisation approaches shall be used for the different types of non-performing exposures: (a) for non-performing exposures classified as defaulted in accordance with Article 178 CRR, the categori sation approach of that Article shall be applied; (b) for exposures that are classified as non-performing due to impairment under the applicable accounting framework, the recognition criteria for impairment under the applicable accounting framework shall be applied; (c) for other non-performing exposures that are neither classified as defaulted nor as impaired, the provisions of Article 178 CRR for defaulted exposures shall be applied. 227. Where an institution has on-balance sheet exposures to a debtor that are past due by more than 90 days and the gross carrying amount of the past due exposures represents more than 20 % of the gross carrying amount of all on-balance sheet exposures to that debtor, all on- and off-balance sheet exposures to that debtor shall be considered as non-performing. Where a debtor belongs to a group, the need to consider also exposures to other entities of the group as non-performing shall be assessed, except for exposures affected by isolated disputes that are unrelated to the solvency of the counterparty.EN L 97/ . 228. Exposures shall be considered to have ceased being non-performing where all of the conditions provided in Article 47a(4) CRR are met. 230. The classification of a non-performing exposure as non-current asset held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 shall not discontinue their classification as non-performing exposure in accordance with Article 47a(5) CRR. 231. Granting forbearance measures to a non-performing exposure shall not discontinue the non-performing status of this exposure. Where exposures are non-performing with forbearance measures, as referred to in paragraph 262, those exposures shall be considered to have ceased being non-performing where all the conditions provided in Article 47a(6) CRR are met. 232. Where the conditions referred to in paragraph 231 of this Part of this Annex are not met at the end of the one year period specified in point (b) of Article 47a(6) CRR, the exposure shall continue to be identified as non-performing forborne exposure until all conditions are met. The conditions shall be assessed at least on a quarterly basis. 233. The accounting portfolios under IFRS listed in paragraph 15 of Part 1 of this Annex and under relevant national GAAP based on BAD listed in paragraph 16 of Part 1 of this Annex shall be reported as follows in template 18: (a) ‘Debt instruments at cost or at amortised cost’ shall encompass debt instruments included in any of the following: (i) ‘Financial assets at amortised cost’ (IFRS); (ii) ‘Non-trading non-derivative financial assets at a cost based method’, including debt instruments under moderate LOCOM (national GAAP based on BAD); (iii) ‘Other non-trading non-derivative financial assets’, except debt instruments measured at strict LOCOM (national GAAP based on BAD); (b) ‘Debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income or through equity subject to impairment’ shall encompass debt instruments included in any of the following: (i) ‘Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income’ (IFRS); (ii) ‘Non-trading non-derivative financial assets measured at fair value to equity’, where instruments in that measurement category can be subject to impairment in accordance with the applicable accounting framework under national GAAP based on BAD; (c) ‘Debt instruments at strict LOCOM, or at fair value through profit or loss or through equity not subject to impairment’ shall encompass debt instruments included in any of the following: (i) ‘Non-trading financial assets mandatorily at fair value through profit or loss’ (IFRS); (ii) ‘Financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss’ (IFRS); (iii) ‘Non-trading non-derivative financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss’ (national GAAP based on BAD); (iv) ‘Other non-trading non-derivative financial assets’ where debt instruments are measured under strict LOCOM (national GAAP based on BAD); (v) ‘Non-trading non-derivative financial assets measured at fair value through equity’, where debt instruments in that measurement category are not subject to impairment in accordance with the applicable accounting framework under GAAP based on BAD.EN.  L 97/ 234. Where IFRS or the relevant national GAAP based on BAD provide for the designation of commitments at fair value through profit and loss, the carrying amount of any asset resulting from that designation and measurement at fair value shall be reported in ‘Financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss’ (IFRS) or ‘Non-trading non-derivative financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss’ (national GAAP based on BAD). The carrying amount of any liability resulting from that designation shall not be reported in template 18. The notional amount of all commitments designated at fair value through profit or loss shall be reported in template 9. 234i. The following exposures shall be identified in separate rows: (a) Loans collateralised by immovable property as defined in paragraphs 86(a) and 87of this Part; (b) Credit for consumption as defined in paragraph 88(a) of this Part. 235. Past due exposures shall be reported separately within the performing and non-performing categories for their entire amount as defined in paragraph 96 of this Part. Exposures past due by more than 90 days but that are not material in accordance with Article 178 CRR shall be reported within performing exposures in ‘Past due > 30 days <= 90 days’. 236. Non-performing exposures shall be reported broken down by past due time bands. In case of application of the debtor approach for the classification of exposures as non-performing referred to in paragraph 226 of this Part of this Annex, the exposures of the debtor shall be reported in the past-due time bands of non-performing in accordance with their individual past-due status. Exposures that are not past due or are past due by 90 days or less, but are nevertheless identified as non-performing due to the likelihood of non-full repayment, shall be reported in a dedicated column. Exposures that present both past due amounts and a likelihood of non-full repayment shall be allocated by past-due time bands consistent with the number of days that they are past due. 237. The following exposures shall be identified in separate columns: (a) exposures which are considered to be impaired in accordance with the applicable accounting framework; under IFRS, the amount of credit-impaired assets (Stage 3) which does not include purchased or originated credit impaired assets, shall be reported; under national GAAP, the amount of impaired assets shall be reported; (b) exposures in respect of which a default is considered to have occurred in accordance with Article 178 CRR; (c) under IFRS, assets with significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, but not credit- impaired (Stage 2) which do not include purchased or originated credit impaired assets; (d) under IFRS, for performing exposures, assets without significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition (Stage 1); (e) exposures which are considered as purchased or originated financial assets that are credit-impaired at initial recognition in accordance with IFRS 9 Appendix A, including any off-balance sheet exposures that are deemed credit-impaired upon their initial recognition; (f) for performing exposures, the amount of accumulated impairment for exposures past due by more than 30 days. 238. Accumulated impairment, accumulated negative changes in fair value due to credit risk and provisions shall be reported in accordance with paragraphs 11, 69 to 71, 106 and 110of this Part. 239. Information on collateral held and guarantees received on performing and non-performing exposures shall be reported separately. Amounts reported for collateral received and guarantees received shall be calculated in accordance with paragraphs 172 and 174of this Part. The sum of the amounts reported for both collateral and guarantees shall be capped at the carrying amount or nominal amount after deduction of provisions of the related exposure.EN L 97/ ..  Inflows and outflows of non-performing exposures – loans and advances by counterparty sector () 239i. Template shall provide the inflows and outflows of loans and advances, excluding loans and advances classified as trading financial assets or held for trading, that were classified into or out of the category of non-performing exposures as defined in paragraphs 213 to 239 or 260of this Part. Inflows and outflows of non-performing loans and advances shall be broken down by counterparty sector. 239ii. Inflows to the non-performing exposures category shall be reported on a cumulative basis since the beginning of the financial year. The inflow shall reflect the gross carrying amount of exposures that have become non-performing as defined in paragraphs 213 to 239 or 260 of this Part during the period, including purchased non-performing exposures. An increase in the gross carrying amount of a non- performing exposure due to accrued interest or due to an increase in the accumulated negative changes in fair value due to credit risk shall be reported as an inflow as well. 239iii. For an exposure that during the period has been reclassified multiple times from non-performing to performing or vice versa, the amount of inflows and outflows shall be identified based on a comparison between the status of the exposure (performing or non-performing) at the beginning of the financial year or at initial recognition and its status at the reporting reference date. 239iv. Outflows from the non-performing exposures category shall be reported on a cumulative basis since the beginning of the financial year. The outflow shall reflect the sum of the gross carrying amounts of exposures that cease to be non-performing during the period, and, where applicable, shall include the amount of write-offs made in the context of the partial or full derecognition of the exposure. A decrease in the gross carrying amount of a non-performing exposure due to interest paid or a decrease in the accumulated negative changes in fair value due to credit risk shall be reported as an outflow as well. 239v. An outflow shall be reported in the following cases: (a) a non-performing exposure meets the criteria for ceasing to be classified as non-performing as laid out in paragraphs 228 – 232 of this Part and is reclassified as performing not forborne or performing forborne; (b) a non-performing exposure is partially or totally repaid; in case of partial repayment, only the repaid amount shall be classified as outflow; (c) collateral is liquidated, including outflows due to other liquidation or legal procedures, such as the liquidation of assets other than collateral obtained via legal procedures, and the voluntary sale of the collateral; (d) the institution takes possession of the collateral as referred in paragraph 175 of this Part including cases of debt asset swaps, voluntary surrenders and debt equity swaps; (e) a non-performing exposure is sold; (f) the risk pertaining to a non-performing exposure is transferred and the exposure meets the criteria to be derecognised; (g) a non-performing exposure is written-off partially or totally; in case of partial write-offs, only the written-off amount shall be classified as outflow; (h) a non-performing exposure, or parts of a non-performing exposure, ceases to be non-performing for other reasons.EN.  L 97/ 239vi. The reclassification of a non-performing exposure from one accounting portfolio to another shall be reported neither as inflow nor as outflow. As an exception, the reclassification of a non-performing exposure from any accounting portfolio to ‘held for sale’ shall be reported as outflow from the original accounting portfolio and inflow to ‘held for sale’. 239vii. The following exposures shall be identified in separate rows: (a) commercial real estate (CRE) loans as defined in paragraph 239ix, broken down into CRE loans to SMEs and CRE loans to non-financial corporations other than SMEs; (b) loans collateralised by immovable property as defined in paragraphs 86(a) and 87of this Part; (c) credit for consumption as defined in paragraph 88(a) of this Part.. Commercial Real Estate (CRE) loans and additional information on loans secured by immovable property () 239viii. Template shall present information on commercial real estate loans to non-financial corporations and on loans collateralised by commercial or residential immovable property to non-financial corporations and households respectively, broken down by loan to value ratio (LTV ratio). Loans and advances classified as held for trading, trading financial assets and debt instruments held for sale shall be excluded. 239ix. ‘Commercial real estate (CRE) loans’ shall comprise exposures as defined in section 2, chapter 1, paragraph 1 of the ESRB Recommendation on closing real estate data gaps ( 8 ). 239x. The LTV ratio shall be calculated in accordance with the method for the calculation of the ‘current loan-to- value ratio’ (LTV-C) laid down in section 2, chapter 1, paragraph 1 of the ESRB Recommendation on closing real estate data gaps. 239xi. Information on collateral received and financial guarantees received on loans shall be reported in accordance with paragraph 239of this Part. Consequently, the sum of the amounts reported for both collateral and guarantees shall be capped at the carrying amount of the related exposure.EN  . 19.

FORBORNE EXPOSURES (19) 240. For the purpose of template 19, forborne exposures shall be debt contracts in respect of which forbearance measures as defined in Article 47b(1) and (2) CRR have been applied. 243. Forbearance measures also include the exercise of clauses which, where used at the discretion of the debtor, enable the debtor to change the terms of the contract (‘embedded forbearance clauses’) and which shall be treated as a concession where the institution approves executing those clauses and concludes that the debtor is experiencing financial difficulties. 244. For the purposes of Annexes III and IV as well as this Annex, ‘refinancing’ shall mean the use of debt contracts to ensure the total or partial payment of other debt contracts the terms of which the debtor is unable to comply with. 245. For the purpose of template 19, ‘debtor’ means an obligor within the meaning of Article 47b(4) CRR. 246. For the purpose of template 19, ‘debt’ shall include loans and advances (including also cash balances at central banks and other demand deposits), debt securities and revocable and irrevocable loan commitments given, including those loan commitments that are designated at fair value through profit and loss that are assets at the reporting date. ‘Debt’ shall exclude exposures held for trading. 247. ‘Debt’ shall also include loans and advances and debt securities classified as non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5.EN L 97/ . ( 8 ) Recommendation of the European Systemic Risk Board of 31 October on closing real estate data gaps (ESRB//14), OJ C 31,. , p. 1. 248. For the purposes of template 19, ‘exposure’ shall have the same meaning as ‘debt’ in paragraphs 246 and 247 of this Part. 249. The accounting portfolios under IFRS listed in paragraph 15 of Part 1 of this Annex and under relevant national GAAP based on BAD listed in paragraph 16 of Part 1 of this Annex shall be reported in template 19 in accordance with paragraph 233 of this Part. 250. For the purposes of template 19, ‘institution’ shall mean the institution, which applied the forbearance measures. 251. In template 19 for ‘debt’, the ‘gross carrying amount’ shall be reported in accordance with paragraph 34 of Part 1 of this Annex. For loan commitments given which are off-balance sheet exposures, the nominal amount as defined in paragraph 118 of this Part of this Annex shall be reported. 252. Exposures shall be regarded as forborne where a concession has been made in accordance with Article 47b(1) CRR, irrespective of whether any amount is past due or of the classification of the exposures as impaired in accordance with the applicable accounting framework or as defaulted in accordance with Article 178 CRR. Exposures shall not be treated as forborne where the debtor is not in financial difficulties. Under IFRS, modified financial assets (IFRS and Appendix A) shall be treated as forborne where a concession as defined in Article 47b(1) CRR has been made, regardless of the incidence of the modification on the change in the credit risk of the financial asset since initial recog nition. 254. There is a rebuttable presumption that forbearance has taken place in any of the circumstances listed in Article 47b(3) CRR. 255. Financial difficulties shall be assessed at debtor level as referred to in paragraph 245. Only exposures to which forbearance measures have been applied shall be identified as forborne exposures. 256. Forborne exposures shall be included in the non-performing exposures category or the performing exposures category in accordance with paragraphs 213 to 239 and 260 of this Part. The classification as forborne exposure shall be discontinued where all of the conditions provided in Article 47a(7) CRR are met. 257. Where the conditions referred to in Article 47a(7) CRR are not met at the end of the probation period, the exposure shall continue to be identified as performing forborne under probation until all the conditions are met. The conditions shall be assessed at least on a quarterly basis. 258. Forborne exposures, which are classified as non-current assets held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5, shall continue to be classified as forborne exposures. 259. A forborne exposure may be considered as performing from the date the forbearance measures were applied where both of the following conditions are met: (a) that extension has not led the exposure to be classified as non-performing; (b) the exposure was not considered to be a non-performing exposure at the date the forbearance measures were extended. 260. Where additional forbearance measures are applied to a performing forborne exposure under probation that has been reclassified out of non-performing category or the forborne exposure under probation reclassified out of non-performing category becomes more than 30 days past due, the exposure shall be classified as non-performing in accordance with point (c) of Article 47a(3) CRR.EN.  L 97/ 261. ‘Performing exposures with forbearance measures’ (performing forborne exposures) shall comprise forborne exposures that do not meet the criteria to be considered as non-performing and that are included in the performing exposures category. Performing forborne exposures shall be under probation until all the criteria laid down in Article 47a(7) CRR, including where paragraph 259 of this Part applies, are met. Performing forborne exposures under probation that have been reclassified out of the non-performing forborne exposures category shall be reported separately within the performing exposures with forbearance measures in the column ‘of which: Performing forborne exposures under probation reclassified from non-performing’. 262. ‘Non-performing exposures with forbearance measures’ (non-performing forborne exposures) shall comprise forborne exposures that meet the criteria to be considered as non-performing and that are included in the non-performing exposures category. Those non-performing forborne exposures shall include the following: (a) exposures which have become non-performing due to the application of forbearance measures; (b) exposures which were non-performing prior to the extension of forbearance measures; (c) forborne exposures which have been reclassified from the performing category, including exposures reclassified in application of paragraph 260. 263. Where forbearance measures are extended to exposures which were non-performing prior to the extension of forbearance measures, the amount of those forborne exposures shall be separately identified in the column ‘of which: forbearance of exposures non-performing prior to forbearance measures’. 264. The following non-performing exposures with forbearance measures shall be identified in separate columns: (a) exposures which are considered, in accordance with the applicable accounting framework, to be impaired. Under IFRS, the amount of credit-impaired assets (Stage 3) and the amount of purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets where they are considered as non-performing in accordance with paragraph 215 of this Part shall be reported in this column; (b) exposures in respect of which a default is considered to have occurred in accordance with Article 178 CRR. 265. The column ‘Refinancing’ shall comprise the gross carrying amount of the new contract (‘refinancing debt’) granted as part of a refinancing transaction which qualifies as a forbearance measure, as well as the gross carrying amount of the old re-paid contract that is still outstanding. 266. Forborne exposures combining modifications and refinancing shall be allocated to the column ‘Instruments with modifications of the terms and conditions’ or the column ‘Refinancing’, depending on the measure that has the most impact on cash flows. Refinancing by a pool of banks shall be reported in the column ‘Refinancing’ for the total amount of refinancing debt provided by or refinanced debt still outstanding at the reporting institution. Repackaging of several debts into a new debt shall be reported as a modification, unless there is also a refinancing transaction that has a larger impact on cash flows. Where forbearance through modification of the terms and conditions of a troubled exposure leads to that exposure’s derecognition and to the recognition of a new exposure, that new exposure shall be treated as forborne debt. 267. Accumulated impairment, accumulated negative changes in fair value due to credit risk and provisions shall be reported in accordance with paragraphs 11, 69 to 71, 106 and 110 of this Part.EN L 97/ . 268. Collateral and guarantees received on exposures with forbearance measures shall be reported for all exposures with forbearance measures, regardless of their performing or non-performing status. In addition, collateral and financial guarantees received on non-performing exposures with forbearance measures shall be shown separately. Amounts reported for collateral received and guarantees received shall be calculated in accordance with paragraphs 172 and 174 of this Part. The sum of the amounts reported for both collateral and guarantees shall be capped at the carrying amount of the related on- balance sheet exposure or nominal amount after deduction of provisions of the related off-balance sheet exposure.EN  . 20.

LOANS AND ADVANCES: ADDITIONAL INFORMATION (23) 319. Template 23 presents additional information on loans and advances, excluding loans and advances classified as cash balances at central banks and other demand deposits, held for trading, trading financial assets and debt instruments held for sale. 320. For the purposes of determining the ‘number of instruments’, an instrument shall be understood as a banking product with an outstanding balance and, where applicable, a credit limit, typically being associated with an account. An exposure towards a specific counterparty can consist of multiple instru ments. The number of instruments shall be determined based on the way the institution manages the exposure. The number of instruments shall be indicated separately for exposures in pre-litigation status and exposures in litigation status as defined in paragraphs 321 and 322 of this Part.EN.  L 97/ 321. An exposure shall be ‘in pre-litigation status’ where the debtor has been formally notified that the institution will take legal action against the debtor within a defined time period, unless certain contractual or other payment obligations are met. That shall also include cases where the contract has been terminated by the reporting institution because the debtor is in formal breach of the terms and conditions of the contract and the debtor has been notified accordingly, but no legal action against the debtor has formally been taken by the institution yet. Exposures classified as ‘in pre-litigation status’ can exit this classification if the outstanding amounts are paid or if they enter into litigation status as defined in the following paragraph. 322. An exposure shall be ‘in litigation status’ where legal action against the debtor has formally been taken. This comprises cases where a court of law confirmed that formal judiciary proceedings have occurred or the judiciary system has been notified of the intention to commence legal proceedings. 323. ‘Unsecured loans and advances without guarantees’ refers to exposures for which neither collateral was pledged nor financial guarantees were received; the unsecured part of a partially secured or partially guaranteed exposure shall not be included. 324. Loans and advances with an accumulated coverage ratio of more than 90 % shall be reported separately. For that purpose, the ‘accumulated coverage ratio’ shall be the ratio between the accumulated impairments, respectively the accumulated negative changes in fair value due to credit risk related to a loan or advance as numerator, and the gross carrying amount of that loan or advance as denominator. 325. Loans collateralised by immovable property as defined in paragraphs 86(a) and 87 of this Part as well as commercial real estate loans as defined in paragraph 239ix of this Part shall be reported broken down by loan/collateral ratio (‘loan-to-value’ (LTV) ratio) as defined in paragraph 239x of this Part. 326. Information on collateral held and guarantees received on the loans and advances shall be reported in accordance with paragraph 239 of this Part. Consequently, the sum of the amounts reported for both collateral and guarantees shall be capped at the carrying amount of the related exposure. Immovable property pledged as collateral shall be reported separately in addition. 327. By way of derogation from the previous paragraph, ‘collateral received on loans and advances – uncapped amounts’ shall reflect the full value of the collateral received without a cap at the carrying amount of the related exposure.EN.   24.

Template shall provide a reconciliation of the opening and closing balances of the stock of loans and advances, excluding loans and advances classified as cash balances at central banks and other demand deposits, trading financial assets, held for trading or as held for sale, that are classified as non-performing in accordance with paragraphs 213 to 239 or 260 of this Part and reported in template 18. Inflows and outflows of non-performing loans and advances shall be broken down by type of inflow or outflow.EN L 97/ . 329. Inflows to the category of non-performing exposures shall be reported in accordance with paragraphs 239ii to 239iii and 239vi of this Part, with the exception of inflows to the category ‘held for sale’, which are outside the scope of this template. Inflows shall be broken down by type (source) of inflow. In this context: (a) ‘Inflow due to accrued interest’ shall represent interest accrued on non-performing loans and advances that have not been included in any of the other categories of the breakdown by type (source); in this regard, this inflow captures the interest accrued on non-performing loans and advances that were classified as non-performing at the end of the preceding financial year and have been continuously classified as such ever since; interest accrued on exposures that were classified as non-performing in accordance with paragraphs 213 to 239 or 260 of this Part only during the period shall be reported together with the inflow itself in the corresponding type (source) category; (b) ‘of which: reclassified from performing forborne exposures under probation previously reclassified from non-performing’ shall include ‘performing forborne exposures under probation reclassified from non-performing’, as defined in paragraph 261 of this Part, that were reclassified again as non- performing in accordance with paragraphs 213 to 239 or 260 of this Part during the period; (c) ‘Inflow due to other reasons’ shall capture inflows that cannot be linked to any of the other, specified sources of inflows and shall include, among others, increases in the gross carrying amount of non- performing exposures due to additional amounts disbursed during the period, the capitalisation of past due amounts including capitalised fees and expenses and changes in exchange rates related to non- performing loans and advances that were classified as non-performing at the end of the preceding financial year and have been continuously classified as such ever since. 330. The following exposures shall be reported in separate rows: (a) ‘Inflow more than once’ shall comprise loans and advances that were reclassified multiple times from non-performing to performing or vice versa during the period; (b) ‘Inflow of exposures granted in the past 24 months’ shall represent loans and advances that were granted in the 24 months prior to the reference date and that were classified as non-performing in accordance paragraphs 213 to 239 or 260 of this Part during the period. Of these exposures, those granted during the period shall be reported separately in addition. 331. Outflows from the category of non-performing exposures shall be reported in accordance with paragraphs 239iii to 239vi of this Part, and be broken down by type (reason) of the outflow. In this context, ‘outflow due to write-offs’ shall reflect the amount of write-offs made during the period that cannot be linked to any of the other specified outflow types and shall include also write-offs related to the total extin guishment of all the reporting institution’s rights by expiry of the statue-of-limitations period, forgiveness or other causes occurred during the period. 332. In those cases where an exposure is partially derecognised and the remaining part is reclassified as performing, the outflow pertaining to the reclassification and the outflow pertaining to the derecognition shall be reported as separate outflows. For outflows due to collateral liquidations, sale of exposures, risk transfers and taking possession of collateral, the net cumulated recoveries obtained shall be reported. If, at the moment of collateral liquidations, sale of exposures, risk transfers and taking possession of collateral, a write-off was made, that amount shall be reported as a part of the related outflow type. 333. ‘Net cumulated recoveries’ shall mean (i) the amount of cash or cash equivalents collected, net of related costs, in the context of collateral liquidations, of the sale of exposures and of risk transfers, respectively (ii) the value at initial recognition as defined in paragraph 175i of this Part of the collateral obtained in the context of outflows due to taking possession of collateral. 334. The outflow pertaining to loans and advances that became non-performing during the period and afterwards ceased to meet the criteria for being classified as non-performing shall be reported separately.EN.

Template shall contain a reconciliation of the opening and closing balances of the allowance accounts and the stock of accumulated negative changes in fair value due to credit risk pertaining to loans and advances that are or were classified as non-performing in accordance with paragraphs 213 to 239 or 260 of this Part, excluding loans and advances classified as cash balances at central banks and other demand deposits or as held for sale. 336. ‘Increases during the period’ shall comprise: (a) the stock, as of the reference date, of accumulated impairments and accumulated negative changes in fair value due to credit risk pertaining to loans and advances that became non-performing during the period and are still classified as non-performing at the reporting reference date; (b) the stock, as of the derecognition date, of accumulated impairments and accumulated negative changes in fair value due to credit risk pertaining to loans and advances that became non-performing during the period and were derecognised during the period; and (c) the increase of accumulated impairments and accumulated negative changes in fair value due to credit risk pertaining to loans and advances that were classified as non-performing at the end of the preceding financial year and are either still classified as such at the reporting reference date or were derecognised during the period. 337. The part of the increase attributable to impairments and accumulated negative changes in fair value booked against interest accrued shall be reported separately in addition. 338. ‘Decreases during the period’ shall comprise: (a) the stock, as of derecognition date, of accumulated impairments and accumulated negative changes in fair value due to credit risk pertaining to loans and advances that ceased to be non-performing during the period and exited the institution’s portfolio during the period; (b) the stock, as of the reference date, of accumulated impairments and accumulated negative changes in fair value due to credit risk pertaining to loans and advances that ceased to be non-performing during the period and are still not classified as non-performing at the reference date; (c) the stock, as of the reference date, of accumulated impairments and accumulated negative changes in fair value due to credit risk pertaining to loans and advances that were reclassified as ‘held for sale’ during the period; and (d) the decrease of accumulated impairments and accumulated negative changes in fair value due to credit risk pertaining to loans and advances that were classified as non-performing at the end of the preceding financial year and are still classified as such at the reporting reference date. 339. The following items shall be reported separately: (a) the decrease attributable to the reversal of allowances and the reversal of negative changes in fair value due to credit risk; (b) the decrease attributable to the ‘unwinding’ of discounts in the context of application of effective interest rate’s accounting method.EN L 97/ ..

COLLATERAL OBTAINED BY TAKING POSSESSION AND EXECUTION PROCESSES (25) 341. ‘Collateral obtained by taking possession’ shall include both assets that were pledged by the debtor as collateral and assets that were not pledged by the debtor as collateral, but were obtained in exchange for the cancellation of debt, whether on a voluntary basis or as part of legal proceedings.. Collateral obtained by taking possession other than collateral classified as Property Plant and Equipment (PP&E): inflows and outflows () 342. Template shall be used to present the reconciliation of the opening balance, as of the beginning of the financial year, and the closing balance of the stock of collateral obtained by taking possession, other than collateral classified as property, plant and equipment (PP&E). In addition, the template shall provide information on the related ‘debt balance reduction’ and the value at initial recognition of collateral obtained by taking possession. 343. ‘Debt balance reduction’ shall mean the gross carrying amount of the exposure that was derecognised from the balance sheet in exchange for the collateral obtained by taking possession, at the exact moment of the exchange, and the related impairments and negative changes in fair value due to credit risk accumulated at that point in time. Where, at the moment of exchange, a write-off was made, that amount shall be considered part of the debt balance reduction as well. Derecognitions from the balance sheet due to other reasons, such as cash collections, shall not be reported. 344. ‘Value at initial recognition’ shall have the same meaning as described in paragraph 175i of this Part. 345. With regard to the ‘inflows during the period’: a) the collateral obtained by taking possession shall include: (i) new collateral obtained by taking possession during the period (since the beginning of the financial year), irrespective of whether the collateral is still recognised in the institution’s balance sheet (held) at the reference date or not and (ii) positive changes in valuation of collateral during the period due to different reasons (such as positive changes in fair value, appreciation, reversal of impairment, changes of accounting policies). These types of inflows shall be reported separately in addition. b) the ‘debt balance reduction’ shall reflect the debt balance reduction of the exposure derecognised related to the collateral that was obtained during the period. 346. With regard to the ‘outflows during the period’: a) the collateral obtained by taking possession shall include: (i) collateral sold for cash during the period; (ii) collateral sold with replacement by financial instruments during the period; and (iii) negative changes in valuation of collateral during the period due to different reasons (such as negative changes in fair value, depreciation, impairment, write-off, changes of accounting policies). Those types of outflows shall be reported separately. Where collateral is derecognised in exchange for both cash and financial instruments, the relevant amounts shall be split and allocated to the two outflow types. ‘Collateral sold with replacement by financial instruments’ shall describe cases where the collateral is sold to a counterparty, and the acquisition by that counterparty is financed by the reporting institution. b) the ‘debt balance reduction’ shall reflect the debt balance reduction of the exposure related to cases where the collateral was sold for cash or replaced by financial instruments during the period.EN.  L 97/ 347. In case of a sale of collateral for cash, the ‘Outflow for which cash was collected’ shall be equal to the sum of ‘Cash collected net of costs’ and ‘Profits/.losses from sale of collateral obtained by taking possession’. ‘Cash collected net of costs’ shall mean the amount of cash received net of transaction costs, such as fees and commissions paid to agents, transfer taxes and duties. ‘Profits/.losses from sale of collateral obtained by taking possession’ shall mean the difference between the carrying amount of the collateral measured at the date of derecognition and the amount of cash received net of transaction costs. In case of replacement of collateral with financial instruments as described in paragraph 346 of this Part, the carrying amount of the financing granted shall be reported. 348. Collateral obtained by taking possession shall be reported broken down by ‘time passed since the collateral has been recognised in the institution’s balance sheet. 349. In the context of the presentation of collateral obtained bytime passed since recognition in the balance sheet, the ‘ageing’ of collateral on the balance sheet, i.e. the migration between the predefined time buckets, shall be reported neither as inflow nor as outflow.. Collateral obtained by taking possession other than collateral classified as Property Plant and Equipment (PP&E) – Type of collateral obtained () 350. Template shall include a breakdown of the collateral obtained by taking possession as defined in paragraphs 341 of this Part, by type of collateral obtained. The template reflects collateral recognised in the balance sheet at the reference date, irrespective of the point in time when it was obtained. In addition, the template provides information on the related ‘debt balance reduction’ and ‘value at initial recognition’ as defined in paragraphs 343 and 344 of this Part and on the number of collateral obtained by taking possession and recognised in the balance sheet at the reference date. The number of collateral obtained by taking possession shall be calculated regardless of the carrying amount of the collateral and it can be one or more than one for each exposure derecognized from the balance sheet in exchange for the collateral obtained by taking possession. 351. The type of collateral shall be the ones referred to in paragraph 173 of this Part with the exception of those in point (b) (i) of that paragraph. 352. With regard to collateral in the form of immovable property, the following information shall be reported in separate rows: (a) immovable property that is under construction or development; (b) with regard to commercial immovable property, collateral in the form of land related to commercial real estate corporations, excluding agricultural land. Separate information on land with and without a planning permission shall be reported in addition.. Collateral obtained by taking possession classified as Property Plant and Equipment (PP&E) () 353. In template , information on collateral obtained by taking possession classified as Property Plant and Equipment (PP&E) shall be reported. In addition, the template shall provide information on the related ‘debt balance reduction’ and ‘value at initial recognition’ as defined in paragraphs 343 and 344 of this Part. 354. Information shall be provided on the stock of collateral as of the reference date, irrespective of the point in time it was obtained, and the inflows due to new collateral obtained by taking possession during the period between the beginning and the end of the reference period and that remains recognised in the balance sheet at the reference date. With regard to the ‘debt balance reduction’, the ‘total’ shall reflect the debt balance reduction related to the collateral as of the reference date and the ‘inflows due to new collateral obtained by taking possession’ shall reflect the debt balance reduction related to the collateral that was obtained during the period.EN L 97/ .EN  . 26.

FORBEARANCE MANAGEMENT AND QUALITY OF FORBEARANCE (26) 355. Template 26 shall include detailed information on loans and advances classified as forborne in accordance with paragraphs 240 to 268 of this Part, excluding instruments classified as cash balances at central banks and other demand deposits or as held for sale. Forborne exposures referring to either a modification of the previous terms and conditions or a total or partial refinancing of a troubled debt contract as defined in paragraph 241 of this Part shall be broken-down in more specific types of forbearance measures. 356. The ‘Number of instruments’ shall be determined as defined in paragraph 320of this Part. 357. The gross carrying amount of exposures with forbearance measures shall be allocated to a category reflecting the type of forbearance measure. Where multiple forbearance measures have been applied to an exposure, the gross carrying amount of exposures with forbearance measures shall be allocated to the most relevant type of forbearance measure. The latter shall be identified based on the type of forbearance measure which has the highest impact on the Net Present Value (NPV) of the forborne exposure or by using any other methods considered applicable. 358. The types of forbearance measures shall be the following: (a) grace period/payment moratorium: temporary suspension of repayment obligations with regard to the principal or the interest, with repayments to be resumed at a later point in time; (b) interest rate reduction: permanent or temporary reduction of the interest rate (fixed or variable) to a fair and sustainable rate; (c) extension of maturity/term: extension of the maturity of the exposure, entailing a reduction in instalment amounts by spreading the repayments over a longer period; (d) rescheduled payments: adjustment of the contractual repayment schedule with or without changes to instalment amounts, other than grace periods/payment moratorium, extension of maturity/term and debt forgiveness. That category shall include, among others, capitalisation of arrears and/or accrued interest arrears to the outstanding principal balance for repayment under a sustainable, rescheduled programme; decrease of the amount of principal repayment instalments over a defined period, regardless of whether interests remain to be paid in full or whether they are capitalised or forfeited; (e) debt forgiveness: partial cancellation of the exposure by the reporting institution through forfeiture of right to legally recover it; (f) debt asset swaps: partial replacement of exposures in the form of debt instruments with assets or equity; (g) other forbearance measures, including among others, total or partial refinancing of a troubled debt contract. 359. Where the forbearance measure affects the gross carrying amount of an exposure, the gross carrying amount at the reference date, i.e. after application of the forbearance measure, shall be reported. In the case of refinancing, the gross carrying amount of the new contract (‘refinancing debt’) granted which qualifies as a forbearance measure, as well as the gross carrying amount of the old re-paid contract that is still outstanding shall be reported.EN.  L 97/ 360. The following items shall be reported in separate rows: (a) Instruments that were subject to forbearance measures at multiple points in time, where: (i) ‘Loans and advances having been forborne ‘twice’ and ‘more than twice’ shall mean exposures classified as forborne in accordance with paragraphs 240 to 268 of this Part at the reporting reference date, to which forbearance measures have been applied at two, respectively more than two different points in time. That includes, among others, originally forborne exposures that exited the forborne status (cured forborne exposures), but were granted new forbearance measures after that; (ii) ‘Loans and advances to which forbearance measures were granted in addition to already existing forbearance measures’ shall mean forborne exposures under probation to which forbearance measures were applied in addition to forbearance measures granted at an earlier point in time, without the exposure having cured in between. (b) Non-performing forborne exposures that failed to meet the non-performing exit criteria. That shall comprise non-performing forborne exposures that failed to meet the conditions for ceasing to be non- performing as described in paragraph 232 of this Part at the end of the probation period of 1 year specified in paragraph 231 (b) of this Part. 361. Exposures to which forbearance measures have been granted since the end of the last financial year shall be reported in separate columns.EN  . 30.
