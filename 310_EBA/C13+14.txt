C – CREDIT RISK – SECURITISATIONS (CR SEC). General remarks 106. Where institution acts as originator, the information in this template shall be required for all securiti sations for which a significant risk transfer is recognised. Where the institution acts as investor, all exposures shall be reported. 107. The information to be reported shall be contingent on the role of the institution in the securitisation process. As such, specific reporting items shall be applicable for originators, sponsors and investors. 108. This template shall gather joint information on both traditional and synthetic securitisations held in the banking book.. Instructions concerning specific positions  TOTAL AMOUNT OF SECURITISATION EXPOSURES ORIGINATED Originator institutions shall report the outstanding amount at the reporting date of all current securitisation exposures originated in the securitisation transaction, irrespective of who holds the positions. As such, on-balance sheet securitisation exposures (e.g. bonds, subordinated loans) as well as off-balance sheet exposures and derivatives (e.g. subordinated credit lines, liquidity facilities, interest rate swaps, credit default swaps, etc.) that have been originated in the securitisation shall be reported. In case of traditional securitisations where the originator does not hold any position, the originator shall not consider that securitisation in the reporting of this template. For that purpose, securitisation positions held by the originator shall include early amortisation provi sions, as defined in Article 242(16) CRR, in a securitisation of revolving exposures. - SYNTHETIC SECURITISATIONS: CREDIT PROTECTION TO THE SECURITISED EXPOSURES Articles 251 and 252 CRR. Maturity mismatches shall not be taken into account in the adjusted value of the credit risk mitigation techniques involved in the securitisation structure.. FUNDED CREDIT PROTECTION (C VA) The detailed calculation procedure of the volatility-adjusted value of the collateral (C VA ) which shall be reported in this column is laid down in Article 223(2) CRR.. TOTAL OUTFLOWS: UNFUNDED CREDIT PROTECTION ADJUSTED VALUES (G*) Following the general rule for ‘inflows’ and ‘outflows’, the amounts reported under this column shall appear as ‘inflows’ in the corresponding credit risk template (CR SA or CR IRB) and exposure class to which the reporting entity allocates the protection provider (i.e. the third party to which the tranche is transferred by means of unfunded credit protection). The calculation procedure of the ‘foreign exchange risk’- adjusted nominal amount of the credit protection (G*) is laid down in Article 233(3) CRR.EN  .  NOTIONAL AMOUNT RETAINED OR REPURCHASED OF CREDIT PROTECTION All tranches which have been retained or bought back, e.g. retained first loss positions, shall be reported with their nominal amount. The effect of supervisory haircuts in the credit protection shall not be taken into account when computing the retained or repurchased amount of credit protection. SECURITISATION POSITIONS: ORIGINAL EXPOSURE PRE-CONVERSION FACTORS This column shall include the exposure values of securitisation positions held by the reporting institution, calculated in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 248 CRR, without applying credit conversion factors, gross of value adjustments and provisions, and any non- refundable purchase price discounts on the securitised exposures as referred to in point (d) of Article 248(1) CRR, and gross of value adjustments and provisions on the securitisation position. Netting shall only be relevant with respect to multiple derivative contracts provided to the same SSPE, covered by an eligible netting agreement. In synthetic securitisations, the positions held by the originator in the form of on-balance sheet items and/or investor’s interest shall be the result of the aggregation of columns to.. VALUE ADJUSTMENTS AND PROVISIONS Article 248 CRR. Value adjustments and provisions to be reported in this column shall only refer to securitisation positions. Value adjustments of securitised exposures shall not be considered. EXPOSURE NET OF VALUE ADJUSTMENTS AND PROVISIONS This column shall include the exposure values of securitisation positions calculated in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 248 CRR, net of value adjustments and provisions, without applying conversion factors and gross of any non-refundable purchase price discounts on the securitised exposures as referred to in point (d) of Article 248(1) CRR, and net of value adjustments and provisions on the securitisation position. - CREDIT RISK MITIGATION (CRM) TECHNIQUES WITH SUBSTITUTION EFFECTS ON THE EXPOSURE Point (57) of Article 4(1) CRR, Chapter 4 of Title II of Part Three CRR and Article 249 CRR Institutions shall report in these columns information on credit risk mitigation techniques that reduce the credit risk of an exposure or exposures via the substitution of exposures (as indicated below for Inflows and Outflows). Collateral that has an effect on the exposure value (e.g. if used for credit risk mitigation techniques with substitution effects on the exposure) shall be capped at the exposure value. Items to be reported here: 1. collateral, incorporated in accordance with Article 222 CRR (Financial Collateral Simple Method); 2. eligible unfunded credit protection.. UNFUNDED CREDIT PROTECTION: ADJUSTED VALUES (G A) Unfunded credit protection as defined in Article 4(1)(59), Articles 234 to 236 CRR.EN.   . FUNDED CREDIT PROTECTION Funded credit protection as defined in Article 4(1)(58) CRR, as referred to in the first subparagraph of Article 249(2) CRR and as regulated in Articles 195, 197 and 200 CRR. Credit linked notes and on-balance sheet netting as referred to in Articles 218 and 219 CRR shall be treated as cash collateral. - SUBSTITUTION OF THE EXPOSURE DUE TO CRM: Inflows and outflows within the same exposure classes and, when relevant, risk weights or obligor grades shall be reported.. TOTAL OUTFLOWS Article 222(3), paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 235 and Article 236 CRR. Outflows shall correspond to the covered part of the ‘Exposure net of value adjustments and provisions’ that is deducted from the obligor’s exposure class and, where relevant, risk weight or obligor grade, and subsequently assigned to the protection provider’s exposure class and, where relevant, risk weight or obligor grade. That amount shall be considered as an Inflow into the protection provider’s exposure class and, where relevant, risk weights or obligor grades. TOTAL INFLOWS Securitisation positions which are debt securities and are used as eligible financial collateral in accordance with Article 197(1) CRR and where the Financial Collateral Simple Method is used, shall be reported as inflows in this column. NET EXPOSURE AFTER CRM SUBSTITUTION EFFECTS PRE-CONVERSION FACTORS This column shall include the exposures assigned in the corresponding risk weight and exposure class after taking into account outflows and inflows due to ‘Credit risk mitigation (CRM) techniques with substitution effects on the exposure’.. CREDIT RISK MITIGATION TECHNIQUES AFFECTING THE AMOUNT OF THE EXPOSURE: FUNDED CREDIT PROTECTION FINANCIAL COLLATERAL COMPREHENSIVE METHOD ADJUSTED VALUE (CVAM) Articles 223 to 228 CRR The reported amount shall also include credit linked notes (Article 218 CRR). FULLY ADJUSTED EXPOSURE VALUE (E*) The exposure value of securitisation positions calculated in accordance with Article 248 CRR, but without applying the conversion factors laid down in point (b) of Article 248(1) CRREN  .  OF WHICH: SUBJECT TO A CCF OF 0 % Point (b) of Article 248(1) CRR In this respect, point (56) of Article 4(1) CRR defines a conversion factor. For reporting purposes, fully adjusted exposure values (E*) shall be reported for the 0 % conversion factor. (-)NON REFUNDABLE PURCHASE PRICE DISCOUNT In accordance with point (d) of Article 248(1) CRR, an originator institution may deduct from the exposure value of a securitisation position which is assigned a 1 250 % risk weight any non-refundable purchase price discounts connected with such underlying exposures to the extent that such discounts have caused the reduction of own funds.. SPECIFIC CREDIT RISK ADJUSTMENTS ON UNDERLYING EXPOSURES In accordance with point (d) of Article 248(1) CRR, an originator institution may deduct from the exposure value of a securitisation position, which is assigned a 1 250 % risk weight or is deducted from Common Equity Tier 1, the amount of the specific credit risk adjustments on the underlying exposures as determined in accordance with Article 110 CRR. EXPOSURE VALUE The exposure value of securitisation positions calculated in accordance with Article 248 CRR. EXPOSURE VALUE DEDUCTED FROM OWN FUNDS In accordance with point (b) of Article 244(1), point (b) of Article 245(1) and Article 253(1) CRR, in case of a securitisation position to which a 1 250 % risk weight applies, institutions may, as an alternative to including the position in their calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts, deduct from own funds the exposure value of the position. EXPOSURE VALUE SUBJECT TO RISK WEIGHTS Exposure value minus the exposure value deducted from own funds. SEC-IRBA Point (a) of Article 254(1) CRR - BREAKDOWN BY RW BANDS SEC-IRBA exposures broken down by risk-weight bands. OF WHICH: CALCULATED UNDER ARTICLE 255(4) (PURCHASED RECEIVABLES) Article 255(4) CRR For the purpose of this column, retail exposures shall be treated as purchased retail receivables and non-retail exposures as purchased corporate receivables. SEC-SA Point (b) of Article 254(1) CRREN.    - BREAKDOWN BY RW BANDS SEC-SA exposures broken down by risk-weight bands. For the RW = 1 250 % (W unknown), the fourth paragraph of point (b) of Article 261(2) CRR stipulates that the position in the securitisation shall be risk-weighted at 1 250 % where the institution does not know the delinquency status for more than 5 % of underlying exposures in the pool. SEC-ERBA Point (c) of Article 254(1) CRR - BREAKDOWN BY CREDIT QUALITY STEPS (SHORT/LONG TERM CREDIT QUALITY STEPS) Article 263 CRR SEC-ERBA Securitisation positions with an inferred rating as referred to in Article 254(2) CRR shall be reported as positions with a rating. Exposure values subject to risk weights shall be broken down by short and long-term and credit quality steps (CQS) as laid down in Tables 1 and 2 of Article 263 and Tables 3 and 4 of Article 264 CRR. - BREAKDOWN BY REASON FOR APPLICATION OF SEC-ERBA For each securitisation position, institutions shall consider one of the following options in columns -. AUTO LOANS, AUTO LEASES AND EQUIPMENT LEASES Point (c) of Article 254(2) CRR All auto loans, auto leases and equipment leases shall be reported in this column, even if they qualify for point (a) or (b) of Article 254(2) CRR.

INTERNAL ASSESSMENT APPROACH Article 254(5) CRR on the ‘Internal Assessment Approach’ (IAA) for positions in ABCP programmes - BREAKDOWN BY RW BANDS Internal Assessment Approach exposures broken down by risk-weight bands OTHER (RW = 1 250 %) Where none of the previous approaches is applied, a risk weight of 1 250 % shall be assigned to securitisation positions in accordance with Article 254(7) CRR. - RISK-WEIGHTED EXPOSURE AMOUNT Total risk-weighted exposure amount calculated in accordance with Section 3 of Chapter 5 of Title II of Part Three CRR, prior to adjustments due to maturity mismatches or infringement of due diligence provisions, and excluding any risk weighted exposure amount corresponding to exposures redistributed via outflows to another template. IAA: AVERAGE RISK WEIGHT (%) The exposure-weighted average risk weights of the securitisation positions shall be reported in this column. RWEA OF WHICH: SYNTHETIC SECURITISATIONS For synthetic securitisations with maturity mismatches, the amount to be reported in this column shall ignore any maturity mismatch. ADJUSTMENT TO THE RISK-WEIGHTED EXPOSURE AMOUNT DUE TO MATURITY MISMATCHES Maturity mismatches in synthetic securitisations RW*-RW(SP), as calculated in accordance with Article 252 CRR, shall be included, except in the case of tranches subject to a risk weighting of 1 250 % where the amount to be reported shall be zero. RW(SP) shall not only include the risk weighted exposure amounts reported under column , but also the risk weighted exposure amounts corresponding to exposures redistributed via outflows to other templates. OVERALL EFFECT (ADJUSTMENT) DUE TO INFRINGEMENT OF CHAPTER 2 OF REGULATION (EU) / ( 10 ) In accordance with Article 270a CRR, whenever certain requirements are not met by the institution, competent authorities shall impose a proportionate additional risk weight of no less than 250 % of the risk weight (capped at 1 250 %) which would apply to the relevant securitisation positions under Section 3 of Chapter 5 of Title II of Part Three CRR. BEFORE CAP Total risk-weighted exposure amount calculated in accordance with Section 3 of Chapter 5 of Title II of Part Three CRR, before applying the limits specified in Articles 267 and 268 CRR.EN.
