In the case of multi-seller securitisations where the reporting institution is involved as orig inator, sponsor or original lender, the reporting institution shall provide the identifier of all the entities within its consolidated group that are involved (as originator, sponsor or original lender) in the transaction. If the code is not available or is not known by the reporting institution, the name of the institution shall be reported. In the case of multi-seller securitisations where the reporting institution holds a position in the securitisation as an investor, the reporting institution shall provide the identifier of all the different originators involved in the securitisation, or, if not available, the names of the different originators. Where the names are not known by the reporting institution, the reporting institution shall report that the securitisation is ‘multi-seller’.

Institutions shall report the following abbreviations: Y - Yes; N - No. This column shall not be reported where code ‘E’ (exempted) is reported under column (Type of retention applied). - NON ABCP PROGRAMMES Because of the special character of ABCP programmes resulting from the fact that they comprise several single securitisation positions, ABCP programmes (as defined in Article 242(11) CRR) shall be exempted from reporting in columns , and. ORIGINATION DATE (yyyy-mm-dd) The month and year of the origination date (i.e. cut-off or closing date of the pool) of the securitisation shall be reported in the following format: ‘mm/yyyy’. For each securitisation scheme, the origination date cannot change between reporting dates. In the particular case of securitisation schemes backed by open pools, the origination date shall be the date of the first issuance of securities.

In the case of securitisation schemes backed by closed pools (i.e. the portfolio of securitised assets cannot be enlarged after the origination date), the amount will progressively be reduced. This information shall be reported even where the reporting entity does not hold any positions in the securitisation. INSTITUTION’S SHARE (%) Institution’s share (percentage with two decimals) at reporting date in the securitised portfolio.
