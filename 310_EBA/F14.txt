FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY: FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AT FAIR VALUE (14) 177. Institutions shall report the value of financial instruments measured at fair value according to the hierarchy provided by IFRS. Where national GAAP under BAD require the allocation of assets measured at fair value between different levels of fair value, institutions under national GAAP shall also report this template. 178. ‘Change in fair value for the period’ shall include gains or losses from re-measurements made in accordance with IFRS 9, IFRS 13 or national GAAP, where applicable, in the period of the instruments that continue to exist at the reporting date. Those gains and losses shall be reported as for inclusion in the statement of profit or loss, or where applicable, in the statement of comprehensive income; thus, the amounts to be reported are before taxes. 179. ‘Accumulated change in fair value before taxes’ shall include the amount of gains or losses from re- measurements of the instruments accumulated from the initial recognition to the reference date.
