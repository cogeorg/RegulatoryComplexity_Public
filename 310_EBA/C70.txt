For each time bucket described in paragraph 2, the amount maturing shall be reported in the left-hand column, the amount funds rolled over shall be reported in the ‘Roll over’ column, new funds obtained shall be reported in the ‘New Funds’ column and the net difference between new funds on the one hand and roll-over minus maturing funds on the other shall be reported in the right-hand column. 4. Total net cash flows shall be reported in column 290 and shall equal the sum of all ‘Net’ columns numbered 040, 080, 120, 160, 200, 240 and 280. 5. The average term of funding, in days, for maturing term funds shall be reported in column 300. 6. The average term of funding, in days, of funds rolled over shall be reported in column 310 7. The average term of funding, in days, for new term funds shall be reported in column 320. 8. The ‘Maturing’ amount shall comprise all liabilities that were contractually withdrawable by the provider of the funding or due on the relevant day in the reporting period. It shall always be reported with a positive sign. 9. The ‘Roll-over’ amount shall comprise the maturing amount as defined in paragraphs 2 and 3 that remains with the institution on the relevant day of the reporting period. It shall always be reported with a positive sign. Where the maturity of the funding has changed due to the roll-over event, the ‘roll-over’ amount shall be reported in a time bucket in accordance with the new maturity. 10. The ‘New funds’ amount shall comprise actual inflows of funding on the relevant day in the reporting period. It shall always be reported with a positive sign. 11. The ‘Net’ amount shall be considered as a change of funding within a particular original maturity time band on the relevant day of the reporting period, and shall be calculated by adding in the ‘net’ column the new funds plus the roll over funds minus the maturing funds. 12.
