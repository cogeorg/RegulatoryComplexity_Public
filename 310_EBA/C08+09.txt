Instructions concerning specific positions  Instructions INTERNAL RATING SCALE/PD ASSIGNED TO THE OBLIGOR GRADE OR POOL (%) The PD assigned to the obligor grade or pool to be reported shall be based on the provisions laid down in Article 180 CRR. For each individual grade or pool, the PD assigned to the specific obligor grade or pool shall be reported. For figures corresponding to an aggregation of obligor grades or pools (e.g. total exposures), the exposure weighted average of the PDs assigned to the obligor grades or pools included in the aggregation shall be provided. The exposure value (column ) shall be used for the calculation of the exposure-weighted average PD. For each individual grade or pool, the PD assigned to the specific obligor grade or pool shall be reported. All reported risk parameters shall be derived from the risk parameters used in the internal rating scale approved by the respective competent authority. It is neither intended nor desirable to have a supervisory master scale. If the reporting institution applies a unique rating scale or is able to report in accordance with an internal master scale, that scale shall be used. Otherwise, the different rating scales shall be merged and ordered in accordance with the following criteria: Obligor grades of the different rating scales shall be pooled and ordered from the lower PD assigned to each obligor grade to the higher. Where the institution uses a large number of grades or pools, a reduced number of grades or pools to be reported may be agreed with the competent authorities. The same applies for continuous rating scales: a reduced number of grades to be reported shall be agreed with the competent authorities. Institutions shall contact their competent authority in advance if they want to report a different number of grades in comparison with the internal number of grades. The last rating grade or grades shall be dedicated for defaulted exposures with PD of 100 %. For the purposes of weighting the average PD, the exposure value reported in column 110 shall be used. The exposure weighted average PD shall be computed taking into account all exposures reported in a given row. In the row where only defaulted exposures are reported the average PD shall be of 100 %.EN  .  Instructions ORIGINAL EXPOSURE PRE-CONVERSION FACTORS Institutions shall report the exposure value before taking into account any value adjustments, provisions, effects due to credit risk mitigation techniques or credit conversion factors. The original exposure value shall be reported in accordance with Article 24 CRR and para graphs 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 and 7 of Article 166 CRR. The effect resulting from Article 166(3) CRR (effect of on balance sheet netting of loans and deposits) shall be reported separately as Funded Credit Protection and shall therefore not reduce the Original Exposure. For derivative instruments, repurchase transactions, securities or commodities lending or borrowing transactions, long settlement transactions and margin lending transactions subject to counterparty credit risk (Chapter 4 or Chapter 6 of Title II of Part Three CRR), the original exposure shall correspond to the exposure value arising from counterparty credit risk (see instructions to column ).

That amount shall be considered as an inflow into the guarantor’s exposure class and, where relevant, obligor grades or pools. Inflows and outflows within the same exposure classes and, where relevant, obligor grades or pools, shall also be considered. Exposures stemming from possible in- and outflows from and to other templates shall be taken into account.

This template aims at receiving more information regarding the elements of the institution-specific countercyclical capital buffer. The information required refers to the own funds requirements determined in accordance with Title II and Title IV of Part Three CRR and the geographical location for credit exposures, securitisation exposures and trading book exposures relevant for the calculation of the insti tution-specific countercyclical capital buffer (CCB) in accordance with Article 140 CRD (relevant credit exposures). 89. Information in template C shall be reported for the ‘Total’ of relevant credit exposures across all jurisdictions where those exposures are located and individually for each of the jurisdictions in which relevant credit exposures are located. The total figures as well as the information of each jurisdiction shall be reported in a separate dimension. 90.
