Institutions shall report the information about the transaction volume and prices paid by institutions for funding obtained during the reporting period and still present at the end of the reporting period in template C in accordance with the following original maturities: — overnight in columns 010 and 020; — greater than overnight and less than or equal to 1 week (columns 030 and 040); — greater than 1 week and less than or equal to 1 month in columns 050 and 060; — greater than 1 month and less than or equal to 3 months in columns 070 and 080; — greater than 3 months and less than or equal to 6 months in columns 090 and 100; — greater than 6 months and less than or equal to 1 year in columns 110 and 120;EN L 97/ . — greater than 1 year and less than or equal to 2 years in columns 130 and 140; — greater than 2 years and less than or equal to 5 years in columns 150 and 160; — greater than 5 years and less than or equal to 10 years in columns 170 and 180. In case of currency revaluations, no new funding is obtained in the original currency and the reporting institution has not paid anything beyond the original price at the initial deposit of the funds. Thus, a positive increment caused by the currency revaluation shall not be reported in this template. 2. For the purposes of determining the maturity of the funding obtained, institutions shall ignore the period between trade date and settlement date, e.g. a three-month liability settling in two weeks’ time shall be reported in the 3 months maturity (columns 070 and 080). 3. The spread reported in the left hand column of each time bucket shall be one of the following: (a) the spread payable by the institution for liabilities less than or equal to one year, if they were to have been swapped to the benchmark overnight index for the appropriate currency no later than close of business on the day of the transaction; (b) the spread payable by the firm at issuance for liabilities with an original maturity greater than one year, were they to be swapped to the relevant benchmark index for the appropriate currency which is three month EURIBOR for EUR or a similar index for other currencies, no later than close of business on the day of the transaction. Solely for the purposes of spread calculation under points a) and b) above, on the basis of historical experience, the institution may determine the original maturity with or without taking into account optionality, as appropriate. 4. Spreads shall be reported in basis points with a negative sign in case the new funding is cheaper than under the relevant benchmark rate. They shall be calculated on a weighted average basis. 5. For the purposes of calculating the average spread payable across multiple issuances/deposits/loans, institutions shall calculate the total cost in the currency of issue ignoring any FX swap, but they shall include any premium or discount and fees payable or receivable, taking as a basis the term of any theoretical or actual interest rate swap matching the term of the liability. The spread shall be the liability rate minus the swap rate. 6. The amount of funding obtained for the funding categories listed in the ‘Item’ column shall be reported in the ‘volume’ column of the applicable time bucket. 7. In the column ‘volume’, institutions shall provide the amounts representing the carrying amount of the new funding obtained in the applicable time bucket in accordance with original maturity. 8. As for all items, also for off-balance sheet commitments, institutions shall only report the related amounts reflected in the balance sheet. An off-balance sheet commitment provided to the institution shall only be reported in C after a drawdown. In the case of a drawdown, the volume and spread to be reported shall be the amount drawn and applicable spread at the end of the reporting period. Where the drawdown cannot be rolled-over at the discretion of the institution, the actual maturity of the drawdown shall be reported. Where the institution has already drawn on the facility at the end of the previous reporting period, and where the institution subsequently increases the usage of the facility, only the additional amount drawn shall be reported. 9. Deposits placed by retail customers shall consist of deposits as defined in Article 3(8) of Delegated Regulation (EU) /61. 10. For funding that has rolled-over during the reporting period that is still outstanding at the end of the reporting period the average of spreads applying at that time (i.e. end of reporting period) shall be reported. For the purposes of C , funding that rolled-over and is still there at the end of the reporting period shall be considered to represent new funding.EN.  L 97/ 11. By way of deviation from the rest of Section , the volume and spread of sight deposits shall only be reported where the depositor did not have a sight deposit in the preceding reporting period or where there is an increase in the deposit amount compared to the previous reference date, in which case the increment shall be treated as new funding. The spread shall be that of the end of the period. 12. Where there is nothing to report, cells relating to spreads shall be left empty. 13.
