BREAKDOWN OF FINANCIAL ASSETS BY INSTRUMENT AND BY COUNTERPARTY SECTOR (4) 67. Financial assets shall be broken down by accounting portfolio and instrument and – where required – by counterparty. For debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income and at amortised cost, the gross carrying amount of assets and accumulated impairments shall be broken down by impairment stages, except where they are purchased or originated financial assets that are credit-impaired at initial recognition as defined in IFRS 9 Appendix A. For these assets, the gross carrying amount and accumulated impairment shall be separately reported, outside the impairment stages, in templates and. 68. Derivatives reported as trading financial assets under GAAP based on BAD include instruments measured at fair value as well as instruments measured at cost-based methods or LOCOM.EN L 97/ . 69. For the purposes of Annexes III and IV as well as this Annex, ‘accumulated negative changes in fair value due to credit risk’ means, for non-performing exposures, accumulated changes in fair value due to credit risk where the accumulated net change is negative. The accumulated net change in fair value due to credit risk shall be calculated by adding all negative and positive changes in fair value due to credit risk that have occurred since recognition of the debt instrument. That amount shall only be reported where the addition of positive and negative changes in fair value due to credit risk results in a negative amount. The valuation of the debt instruments shall be performed on the level of single financial instruments. For each debt instrument, ‘Accumulated negative changes in fair value due to credit risk’ shall be reported until the derecognition of the instrument. 70. For the purposes of Annexes III and IV as well as this Annex, ‘accumulated impairment’ shall have the following meaning: (a) for debt instruments measured at amortised cost or at a cost-based method, that are not purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets, accumulated impairment is the cumulative amount of impairment losses, net of use and reversals that has been recognised, where appropriate for each of the impairment stages. Accumulated impairment reduces the carrying amount of the debt instrument through the use of an allowance account under IFRS and national GAAP based on BAD, or via direct reductions that do not constitute a derecognition event under national GAAP based on BAD; (b) for debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income under IFRS that are not purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets, accumulated impairment is the sum of expected credit losses and their variations recognised as a reduction of fair value on a given instrument since initial recognition; (c) for debt instruments at fair value through equity under national GAAP based on BAD subject to impairment, accumulated impairment is the cumulative amount of impairment losses, net of use and reversals that has been recognised. The reduction in the carrying amount is either made through use of an allowance account or via direct reductions that do not constitute a derecognition event. (d) for purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets, the initial estimate of lifetime expected credit losses is incorporated into the calculation of the credit-adjusted effective interest rate and accumulated impairment is the sum of subsequent changes in lifetime expected credit losses since initial recognition that are recognized as a variation of carrying amount/fair value on a given instrument. Accumulated impairment for purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets can be positive in case of impairment gains exceeding any previously recognised impairment losses (IFRS ). 71. Under IFRS, accumulated impairment shall include the allowance for expected credit losses for financial assets under each of the impairment stages specified by IFRS 9 and the allowance for purchased or originated credit- impaired financial assets. Under national GAAP based on BAD, it shall include specific and general allowance for credit risk, as well as the general allowance for banking risk where it reduces the carrying amount of debt instruments. Accumulated impairment shall also include the credit risk-induced value adjustments on financial assets under LOCOM. 72. ‘Accumulated partial write-offs’ and ‘Accumulated total write-offs’ shall include, respectively, the accumulated partial and total amount as at the reference date of principal and accrued past due interest and fees of any debt instrument that has been de-recognised to date using either of the methods described in paragraph 74 because the institution has no reasonable expectations of recovering the contractual cash flows. Those amounts shall be reported until the total extinguishment of all the reporting institution’s rights by expiry of the statute-of-limitations period, forgiveness or other causes, or until recovery. Therefore, where the written-off amounts are not recovered, they shall be reported while they are subject to enforcement activities.EN.  L 97/ 73. Where a debt instrument is eventually totally written-off because of successive partial write-offs, the cumu lative amount written-off shall be reclassified from the ‘Accumulated partial write-offs’ into the ‘Accumulated total write-offs’ column. 74. Write-offs shall constitute a derecognition event and relate to a financial asset in its entirety or to a portion of it, including where the modification of an asset leads the institution to give up its right of collecting cash flows on a portion or the entirety of this asset as further explained in paragraph 72. Write-offs shall include amounts caused by both reductions of the carrying amount of financial assets recognised directly in profit or loss and reductions in the amounts of the allowance accounts for credit losses taken against the carrying amount of financial assets. 75. The column ‘of which: Instruments with low credit risk’ shall include instruments that are determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date and for which the institution assumes that the credit risk has not increased significantly since initial recognition in accordance with IFRS. 76. Trade receivables within the meaning of IAS (h), contract assets and lease receivables for which the simplified approach of IFRS for the estimation of loss allowances has been applied, shall be reported within loans and advances in template. The corresponding loss allowance for those assets that are not purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets shall be reported in either ‘Accumulated impairment on assets with significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition but not credit-impaired (Stage 2)’ or ‘Accumulated impairment on credit-impaired assets (Stage 3)’, depending on whether trade receivables, contract assets or lease receivables under the simplified approach are considered as credit-impaired assets. 78. In template , institutions shall report the carrying amount of ‘Loans and advances’ and ‘Debt securities’ that fall within the definition of ‘subordinated debt’ in paragraph 100 of this Part. 79. In template , information to be reported depends on whether Non-trading non-derivative financial assets measured at fair value to equity can be subject to impairment requirements in application of the national GAAP based on BAD. Where those financial assets are subject to impairment, institutions shall report information in this template that relates to the carrying amount, the gross carrying amount of unimpaired assets and impaired assets, accumulated impairment and accumulated write-offs. Where those financial assets are not subject to impairment, institutions shall report the accumulated negative changes in fair value due to credit risk for non-performing exposures. 80. In template , financial assets measured under moderate LOCOM and their associated value adjustments shall be identified separately from other financial assets measured at a cost-based method and their associated impairment. Financial assets under a cost-based method, including financial assets under moderate LOCOM, shall be reported as unimpaired assets where they have no value adjustments or impairment associated with them, and as impaired assets in case they have value adjustments that qualify as impairment or impairment associated with them. Value adjustments that qualify as impairment shall be credit risk-induced value adjustments reflecting the deterioration of the creditworthiness of the counterparty. Financial assets under moderate LOCOM with market-risk induced value adjustments reflecting the impact of changes in the market conditions on the value of the asset shall not be considered as impaired. Accumulated credit-risk induced and market-risk induced value adjustments shall be reported separately. 81. In template , assets measured at strict LOCOM as well as their associated value adjustments shall be reported separately from assets under other measurement methods. Financial assets under strict LOCOM and financial assets under other measurement methods shall be reported as impaired assets in case they have credit-risk induced value adjustments as defined in paragraph 80 or impairment associated with them. Financial assets under strict LOCOM with market risk induced value adjustments as defined in paragraph 80 shall not be considered as impaired. Accumulated credit-risk induced and market-risk induced value adjustments shall be reported separately.EN L 97/ . 82. Under national GAAP based on BAD, the amount of general allowances for banking risk to be reported in the applicable templates shall only be the part that affects the carrying amount of debt instruments (BAD Article ).EN  . 7.

FINANCIAL ASSETS SUBJECT TO IMPAIRMENT THAT ARE PAST DUE (7) 94. The carrying amount of debt instruments that are included in the accounting portfolios subject to impairment shall be reported in template only where they are past due. Past-due instruments shall be allocated to the corresponding past-due buckets on the basis of their individual situation. 95. Accounting portfolios subject to impairment shall be financial assets subject to impairment, as defined as in paragraph 93 of this Part. 96. Financial assets shall qualify as past due where any amount of principal, interest or fee has not been paid at the date it was due. Past due exposures shall be reported for their entire carrying amount and broken down according to the number of days of the oldest past due amount unpaid at the reference date. Under IFRS, the carrying amounts of assets that are not purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets shall be reported by impairment stages; the carrying amount of purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets shall be separately reported. Under national GAAP based on BAD, past-due assets shall be reported by impairment status in accordance with the applicable accounting standards.
